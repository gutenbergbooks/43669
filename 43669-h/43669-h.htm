<p>The design originally proposed, when the following work was
undertaken, has been somewhat departed from during its progress
towards completion. Not only did the interest awakened
by the various subjects treated of greatly increase, as the Author
proceeded in his attempt to describe the scenes in which the
Nemesis bore so distinguished a part, but the introduction of
much collateral matter seemed to be called for, in order to enable
him fully to illustrate the current of passing events. Hence the
narrative of the adventures of the Nemesis gradually expanded
itself into a complete history of the origin, progress, and termination
of all the recent interesting occurrences in China, including
a full and accurate account of all the operations of the
war, and of the complicated difficulties from which it originated,
as well as of the peculiar features that marked its progress.</p>

<p>In addition, therefore, to her own interesting tale, the Nemesis
supplied a valuable foundation upon which to build up a more
enlarged history. The Author had long taken a deep interest
in all that concerned our relations with China; and with a view
to study personally the character of the people, and to obtain
accurate information by observation on the spot, he paid a
lengthened visit to that country in 1842. He there had the
good fortune to fall in with the Nemesis, and through the kindness
of Captain Hall, he subsequently proceeded in her to Calcutta
in the beginning of 1843. He has thus been enabled to
add to the history of the operations copious notices of the various
places visited by the expedition; and has given a full description
of the New Colony of Hong-Kong, with remarks upon its
vast importance as a possession of the British empire upon the
threshold of China.</p>

<p>Incidental observations have been introduced upon the character
of the Chinese people, and the new prospects which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
been opened to us, through the extraordinary changes which
have taken place in our intercourse with them, in a social, moral,
mercantile, and religious point of view. These will be met with
according as they were suggested by particular occurrences, or
prompted by localities described in the work. The Maps and
Illustrations will also contribute to give interest to the Narrative.</p>

<p>The Author owes some apology to naval and military readers
for the apparent presumption with which he has ventured to
handle so many details of a professional character; nor indeed
would he have undertaken the task without the able advice and
correction of officers who were themselves actors in the scenes
described. The valuable assistance and co-operation of Captain
Hall, who was actively employed in China during the whole
period of the war, and whose services in command of the
Nemesis need no extraneous encomium, were indispensable to
the completion of the work. The Author also gladly avails himself
of this opportunity of acknowledging the kindness of Capt.
Sir Thomas Herbert, R.N., K.C.B., who obligingly permitted
him to have access to his plans and documents; and to numerous
other naval and military officers the best thanks of Captain Hall
and himself are due.</p>

<p>Those readers who are alive to the important progress of
steam navigation cannot fail to take a deep interest in the history
of the first iron steamer that ever doubled the Cape of Good
Hope. In the narrative of her curious and protracted voyage
will be found many notices of the places she visited, and in particular
of some of the Portuguese slave settlements on the east
coast of Africa, at Delagoa Bay at Mozambique, &amp;c. The description
given of the Comoro Islands will probably be quite new
to most readers.</p>

<p>At the end of the work will be found an account of a visit to
some of the harbours of the important island of Hainan, which
must acquire greater importance through the progressive increase
of our commercial intercourse with China; and in the Appendix
have been added the new regulations concerning trade in China,
and an abstract of the supplementary treaty recently concluded.</p>

<p>With much diffidence, but entertaining a hope that the
numerous subjects touched upon in these volumes have not been
hastily or crudely handled, the Author commits his Narrative to
the kind indulgence of his readers.</p>

</div>

<p>The rapid sale of the first edition, and the unexpected favour
which the work has met with, have induced the Author to put
forth a second edition, in a somewhat condensed and cheaper
form. While no passages have been omitted which appeared
essential to the completeness of the narrative, and none curtailed
which seemed calculated to keep alive the general interest
in the current of events, it is hoped, that the condensation of
the whole into one volume, will be considered advantageous to
a numerous class of readers.</p>

<p>The woodcuts have been all retained, and an additional map
of the east coast of China, comprising all the recent improvements,
has been added. A few corrections in the detail of facts
have been made, at the suggestion of officers engaged, and
it is hoped that this edition will be found to possess some
advantages over the first. The Author gladly takes this opportunity
of thanking the naval and military officers concerned, for
their indulgence, and also a considerate public for the friendly
reception which has been accorded to the work.</p>

<p>The Author is willing to believe that he owes more to the
interest of the subject itself, when simply handled, than to his
own individual efforts, however conscientiously directed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>The year 1839 will long be remembered by all those who have
taken any interest in Eastern affairs. The harsh and unwarrantable
measures of Commissioner Lin, the imprisonment of
Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary and all other English subjects,
and the wild but brief career of uncontrolled violence which
marked his reign, called imperatively on our part for stronger
measures than had yet been resorted to; and such measures
were at once adopted by the Court of Directors of the East India
Company, as well as by the government of the country, their
direct object being to ensure the speedy departure of an adequate
force for the protection of British subjects and British trade in
China, and to demand proper reparation for the violence and
insult offered to Her Majesty's representative.</p>

<p>It was scarcely to be expected that, under these circumstances,
hostilities could be altogether avoided; and, as the
principal scene of them, if they occurred, would be in rivers
and along the coasts, attention was directed to the fitting out
of armed vessels, which should be peculiarly adapted for that
particular service. Iron, as a material for ship-building, had
been already tried, and found to answer; and this was considered
an extremely favourable opportunity for testing the advantages
or otherwise of iron steam-vessels; and the numerous rivers
along the coast of China, hitherto very imperfectly known, and
almost totally unsurveyed, presented an admirable field for these
experiments. If successful there, it might be readily inferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
that their utility in the fine rivers and along the shores of Hindostan,
and other portions of the Company's territories, would
be demonstrated, and by degrees a very powerful steam fleet
would become an invaluable addition to the already vast resources
of the Indian government.</p>

<p>Orders were therefore given for the immediate building of
several stout iron steamers, to be constructed with peculiar reference
to their employment in river navigation. They were all to
be adequately armed and manned, and no reasonable expense
was to be spared in fitting them out in a manner best adapted to
the particular object sought to be attained by them. No iron
steamer had ever yet doubled the Cape of Good Hope; their
qualities, therefore, remained yet to be tested in the stormy seas
about Southern Africa; and various questions respecting the
errors of the compasses, the effects of lightning, &amp;c., upon vessels
of this description, remained still imperfectly solved, particularly
in reference to those tropical regions, where the great phenomena
of nature are exhibited in a more intense and dangerous degree.
In fact, no experience had yet been gained of their capabilities
for the performance of long and perilous voyages; and it was a
bold conception which suggested that they should be sent round
the Cape, to the eastward, in the very worst season of the year,
when even the stoutest and largest <i>wooden ships</i> trust themselves
as little as possible in that stormy region.</p>

<p>The equipment and destination of the Nemesis, however, was
kept a profound secret, except to those who were personally
concerned in it, and even they (with the exception of the authorities)
had little notion of the precise service upon which she
was to be employed.</p>

<p>The Nemesis was at length finished, and sent to sea as a
private armed steamer. She was never commissioned under the
articles of war, although commanded principally by officers
belonging to the Royal Navy; neither was she classed among
the ships of the regular navy of the East India Company. In
short, the Nemesis was equipped under very peculiar circumstances,
which, together with the novelty of her construction,
caused her to become an object of very general interest. The
"<i>wooden</i> walls" of England had, in fact, been so long identified
with her proudest recollections, and had constituted for so many
centuries her national "boast," that it seemed an almost <i>unnational</i>
innovation to attempt to build them of iron. Indeed, it
was rather looked upon as one of the dangerous experiments of
modern days. Moreover, as the <i>floating</i> property of wood,
without reference to its shape or fashion, rendered it the most
natural material for the construction of ships, so did the <i>sinking</i>
property of iron make it appear, at first sight, very ill adapted
for a similar purpose. It was sometimes forgotten that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
wooden ships are composed of wood, iron, and copper together,
and that the bulkiness of these necessary materials greatly
diminishes the buoyancy of the wood.</p>

<p>A minute and scientific description of the structure of the
Nemesis will be found in the United Service Journal for May,
1840, and it will therefore be sufficient, in this place, merely to
notice one or two peculiarities, in which it differs from that of
wooden ships in general. With the exception of the great
paddle-beams, across the ship, and the <i>planks</i> of the deck and
the cabin-fittings, together with one or two other parts, the
names of which would be only intelligible to the scientific reader,
the whole vessel was built of iron.</p>

<p>Credit is due to Mr. Laird, of the Birkenhead Iron Works,
Liverpool, for the admirable manner in which she was constructed,
and for the elegance of her form and model, which
fully answered every purpose required of her.</p>

<p>Her burden was about 680 tons, and her engines of 120-horse
power, constructed by Messrs. Forrester and Co., also of Liverpool;
and with twelve days' supply of coals, together with water
and provisions for four months, and stores of all sorts for two
years, with duplicate machinery, &amp;c., and all her armament complete,
her mean load draught of water was only <i>six feet</i>. But
commonly, in actual service, she drew little more than five feet.
Her length over all was 184 feet, her breadth 29 feet, and her
depth 11 feet. Her keel-plate was laid, and the vessel built and
launched, in the short space of three months.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the Nemesis has no fixed keel, but the lower
plate of iron, which connects the two sides of the ship together
along its middle, is called the keel-plate. She is, therefore,
almost perfectly flat-bottomed; and, in order to obviate, as much
as possible, the disadvantages attendant upon this peculiar construction,
there are two sliding or moveable keels, capable of being
raised or lowered to the depth of five feet below the bottom of
the vessel. Each of these keels is about seven feet in length,
one being placed before and the other abaft the engine-room.
They are each enclosed in a narrow case or tank, one foot wide,
running from the bottom of the vessel up to the deck, and which,
of course being open below, allows the water to rise in it, to the
level of the sea on the outside of the vessel. In this, the keel,
which is of wood, 4&frac12; inches thick, works up and down by means
of a small winch, and a strong chain which is attached to it.
Thus it is evident, that either the foremost or the aftermost keel
can be raised or lowered, independently of the other, if circumstances
require it.</p>

<p>As it would, however, be impossible to steer with accuracy, a
vessel of this construction, with a rudder merely of the ordinary
description, and which, from its shallowness, would, in a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sea, be in a great measure out of water, there is a contrivance by
which a moveable or false rudder is attached to the lower part of
the true or fixed rudder, and which descends to the same depth
as the two false keels, and, like them, can be raised or lowered at
pleasure.</p>

<p>The main or true rudder was composed of wood, but the lower
or false rudder was made of iron, and was so constructed as to
grasp the lower part of the upper or fixed one, firmly on either
side, but was bolted through in such a way as to be moveable, as
if it were fastened by a hinge, so that, by means of a chain run
up to the taffrail from its outer edge, it could be hauled up to any
height required.</p>

<p>The next striking peculiarity in the construction of the Nemesis
was, that the entire vessel was divided into seven water-tight
compartments, by means of iron bulkheads; so that, in fact, it
somewhat resembled a number of iron tanks, cased over, so as
to assume the external form of one connected vessel. By this
means, the occurrence of any accident, such as striking on a
rock, or shot-holes, &amp;c., which might occasion a dangerous leak
in one compartment, would have no effect upon any other part of
the vessel.</p>

<p>The advantages of this arrangement were often tested, during
her three years' hard service; and, indeed, within a few days after
her first departure from Liverpool, as will be presently related,
this contrivance sufficed to save her from the almost certain destruction
which would otherwise have awaited her.</p>

<p>The last peculiarity which it seems necessary here to mention,
was the provision of some kind of instrument for counteracting
the effect of the local attraction of so large a mass of iron upon
the compasses, and for correcting the errors occasioned thereby.
This difficulty had been seriously felt by Colonel Chesney, on
board the small iron steamers which he had under his orders,
during his expedition to the Euphrates; although he was of
opinion, that the placing of the compasses at a certain height
<i>above</i> the vessel, so as to be further removed from the sphere of
the local attraction of the iron, was sufficient to reduce their
errors materially.</p>

<p>Without entering into the merits of Barlow's counteracting
plates, or Professor Airy's interesting discoveries, it will be sufficient
here to mention, that the Nemesis was fitted with correctors,
very much according to the system of Professor Airy, but not
under his own superintendence; that the experiments were conducted
at Liverpool under every disadvantage, and that the result
was never perfectly satisfactory. Indeed, the accident which
shortly befel her, has been attributed, upon strong grounds, principally
to the imperfection of her compasses. It is right, however,
to mention, that other vessels, such as the Phlegethon and Pluto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
which have been fitted with Airy's correctors, tested according to
the most approved principles, and after experiments conducted
with great attention, have been totally relieved from this source
of danger and anxiety, and have been navigated with perfect
accuracy and confidence.</p>

<p>We may now come to the interesting moment of the departure
of the Nemesis from Liverpool, where she was built. Everything
seemed at first to prosper; the weather was favourable, and the
machinery perfect in all its parts. She had cleared the narrowest
part of the Irish Channel, had passed the coast of Wales, and
crossed the entrance to the Bristol Channel; and the course she
had been steering would have taken her well clear of the Land's
End.</p>

<p>It was now the second day since her departure. About two
o'clock in the morning, the weather being still hazy and the night
dark, she struck heavily on a rock.</p>

<p>Of course the engines were instantly stopped, but the <i>way</i> she
already had on her appeared sufficient to carry her over the reef;
and, indeed, the actual rocks themselves could be seen outside of
her, so that she had evidently passed between them and the land,
and had merely struck the edge of the reef.</p>

<p>Finding that the vessel did not <i>hang</i> upon the reef, and was
therefore still afloat, her head was turned to seaward, and the
engines kept working slowly, while the dawn was anxiously expected.
It was now discovered, that the rocks upon which she
had struck were aptly enough called "The Stones," lying at the
entrance to the bay of St. Ives, in Cornwall, and not very far
distant from the Land's End. It was soon evident, also, that the
accident had occasioned a very serious leak, in one of the foremost
compartments of the vessel. It was with difficulty that the water
could be kept lower in it than the level of the sea outside, with
the hand-pump; and, in fact, if the vessel had not been divided
into these water-tight compartments, it is difficult to imagine that
the accident would not have been fatal to her.</p>

<p>However, she was carried, without much difficulty, round the
Land's End, into Mount's Bay, where she anchored about three
miles from Penzance, off St. Michael's Mount. The object here
was to procure an additional pump, in the hope of being able,
by that means, to empty the tank or compartment, so as to be
able to stop the leak from the inside. Fortunately, one perfectly
adapted for the purpose was obtained from a small coasting-vessel
which was at anchor in the bay. It was an iron one, and has
been preserved on board ever since, and, on many occasions, has
been found of the greatest utility. Indeed, every vessel of this
description should be provided with an extra pump of this kind,
to be worked by hand, and at all times ready to be placed into
any compartment, as an additional means of pumping it out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
also as a security against fire, for the purpose of pumping water
into the vessel in case of necessity.</p>

<p>With the assistance of this additional pump, the water in the
compartment was completely emptied, and, then it was discovered
that a hole had been cut completely through her bottom by the
rock, but could now be easily stopped from the inside.</p>

<p>This being speedily effected, the vessel pursued her voyage
without the least difficulty, and came to anchor on the following
evening in Yarmouth Roads, inside the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>It should here be mentioned, that every compartment of the
vessel was provided with a small pipe and cock, by means of
which, the water could be let out of one compartment into another,
and so passed on, from one to the other, into the engine-room,
where it could be pumped out by the machinery. But, as this
appeared a rather clumsy mode of doing it, namely, by floating
nearly half the ship unnecessarily, it was not resorted to. But,
in vessels more recently constructed, a great improvement has
been introduced in this respect. From each of the compartments,
a pipe leads directly into the engine-room itself, without communicating
with any other part; so that, by means of a cock, the
water can at once be pumped out by the engine, or else can be
confined to the compartment itself, and pumped out by hand,
when it is not desirable to let it flow into the engine-room.</p>

<p>As little time as possible was lost in completing the necessary
repairs, and in rendering her in all respects fit to undertake the
long and unknown voyage she was about to perform. At length
she was cleared out for the Russian port of Odessa, much to the
astonishment of every one; but those who gave themselves time
to reflect hardly believed it possible that such could be her real
destination.</p>

<p>She was armed with two 32-pounder guns, mounted on pivot,
or traversing carriages, for the purpose of throwing either shot
or shell, one being placed forward and the other aft, as in all
armed steamers.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On leaving England she had on board about sixty men and
officers; but, during the operations in China, she usually had
about ninety men and officers.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Her daily consumption of fuel
was about eleven tons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>She had no <i>paddle-boats</i>; but in other respects, she was well
found in boats, while in China. She had two cutters, pinnace,
gig, jolly-boat, dingy, and always a large Chinese boat. A large
platform was also built between the paddle-boxes, instead of the
small bridge which is usually constructed there. This platform
covered the whole space between the paddle-boxes, and was
found particularly convenient, when troops were on board, as it
was always occupied by the officers, while the decks were crowded
with the soldiers. There was also a 6-pounder brass pivot gun,
mounted upon the bridge, which was very useful for trying the
range. A rocket tube and a supply of rockets were always kept
in readiness upon this platform, besides ammunition for the
brass gun, &amp;c. In hot weather an awning was spread over it,
and it was always a most convenient place for watching and
directing the operations of the steamer.</p>

<p>Besides the guns above-mentioned, the Nemesis carried four
brass 6-pounders and one small howitzer.</p>

<p>Unusual interest was excited by the expected departure of this
strange vessel, upon a voyage of which both the purpose and the
destination were alike unknown. Even the Admiral himself was
ignorant of the service which she was called upon to perform.</p>

<p>At length, on the 28th of March, 1840, she really had sailed.
The Needle Rocks, the high cliffs at the back of the Isle of
Wight, the shores of England herself, had gradually sunk below
the horizon, and the excitement attending departure had at length
settled down into the cold reality of a first night at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>On the third day, the 30th of March, at daylight, the last
glimpse was taken of the land of our birth. The Lizard disappeared,
and nothing was around but the wide expanse of the
blue ocean. On the gallant vessel went gaily through the Bay
of Biscay, at an average rate of seven to eight knots under steam,
moving gracefully to the heavy swell which at all times prevails
there.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April, she was well in sight of Cape Finisterre,
the dread of seamen, on the rock-bound coast of Portugal, and
encountered a moderate gale of wind, but made head against it
without difficulty.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April, the lovely island of Madeira came full in
sight, the ninth day since she had left Portsmouth, and only the
seventh from the Land's End.</p>

<p>At daylight, the little island of Porto Santo having been
passed, the full prospect of the larger island of Madeira lay
exposed.</p>

<p>Though sailors are seldom poets, there is something in the
aspect of this lovely island which speaks poetry to the least
poetical; and where nature looks so eloquent, and the fresh
green of the loaded vineyard contrasts so beautifully with the
wilder rocks above it, while the sun of its scarce-failing summer
sheds its glow upon the varied woods around, even the iron
Nemesis and her iron-hearted crew were cheered and gladdened,
as she glided close along the shore.</p>

<p>The Nemesis was not long in coming to anchor within the
bay, not very far from the town, and between it and the remarkable
rock called the Loo Rock.</p>

<p>Time was precious, and the great object of her visit was to
be accomplished as soon as possible&mdash;namely, in the stoker's
language, "coaling"&mdash;an operation anything but pleasant. But
they who would enjoy the steamer's "stately march upon the
waters" must be content to purchase it at the price of this
necessary evil.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>On the evening of the 8th April, the steamer was again
standing out of the Bay of Funchal, after being detained there
only three days. It has been already stated that the vessel was
not under the articles of war; this was well known to all the
crew, although the majority of her officers belonged to Her
Majesty's navy. Even in this early part of her career the
difficulty had been seriously felt; and none but those who have
been placed in similar circumstances, as commanding officers,
can form any notion of the great forbearance, tact, and judgment
which are daily required on their part, in the management of
their men.</p>

<p>On the 11th, she passed quietly through the Canary Islands,
between Palma and Teneriffe, the high peak of the latter, however,
not being visible, owing to the hazy weather. The Nemesis
was now entirely under canvass, and the steam was not got up
for twelve or thirteen days after her departure from Madeira.
The north-east trade-wind soon carried her smoothly along, as
she passed about midway between the Cape de Verd Islands and
the coast of Africa, and it was only in a calm, not far from Sierra
Leone, that she had occasion to use her engines. She was
found to sail remarkably well without steam, although so flat-bottomed.</p>

<p>Thus she proceeded quietly along the coast, until she reached
the neighbourhood of Cape Formoso, towards which she was set
by strong and unusual southerly winds and a lee-current. She
was, however, not long in reaching Princes' Island, situated near
the coast of Africa. This is a settlement belonging to the
Portuguese, and the principal place of resort for our cruisers in
that quarter, not very far from Fernando Po. She cast anchor
in West Bay, Princes' Island, on the evening of the 14th May,
forty-four days from England, principally under sail. Here she
remained, undergoing a necessary refit, cutting wood for fuel,
and preparing for sea, until the evening of the 23rd.</p>

<p>It is the practice here for every English man-of-war, of those
stationed on the coast, which resort to the island, to leave a
Krooman<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in her pay, for the purpose of cutting wood for the
ship, in readiness for her return. As there are generally several
vessels on the coast, so are there also several Kroomen belonging
to them, who join together, and go out to cut wood, lending each
other mutual assistance. The wood is then brought down to the
coast, and stacked in piles, one for each ship, the name of the
particular ship being written on it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>As the Nemesis was furnished with a letter from the Admiralty,
requiring all Her Majesty's ships to give her every assistance in
their power, she was not long in taking on board the whole stock
of wood already laid up for the little squadron. Captain Tucker,
then commanding the Wolverine, was most active in lending his
aid, and even gave up the supply of wood he already had on
board. In this way about seventy tons of good hard wood were
at last taken on board the Nemesis, and, as plenty of coal still
remained, there could be little doubt that, with this reinforcement,
she would be able to reach the Cape of Good Hope
without difficulty. Water is easily procured in the immediate
neighbourhood of the landing-place, of excellent quality; and
thus two very important items for the recruiting of a ship are to
be found in abundance in Princes' Island. Pigs, poultry, and
goats are to be had in any quantity, as well as yams, Indian
corn, coffee, bananas, pineapples, and limes. Above all, the
anchorage at Princes' Island is good in all seasons, and of easy
access, either by day or night. It is consequently a very valuable
place of call for vessels going by the eastern passage to the Cape,
which in some seasons is to be preferred to the western route,
particularly for steamers.</p>

<p>On the side of the island opposite to West Bay, or the north-east,
is the town and harbour of Port St. Antonio, where the
governor of the island resides. It is tolerably secure, but confined,
and by no means equal to West Bay for shipping. There
is a respectable Portuguese merchant there, who is in the habit
of supplying the ships at West Bay with various stores that they
may require; and, with the view of furnishing all the information
which could be procured, in case any other steamer should touch
there, application was made to Mr. Carnaero, the reply to which
was, that he would supply any quantity, at the rate of one
Spanish dollar for every hundred logs;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but if they were
required to be cut into smaller pieces it would cost more, as
negroes would have to be hired for the purpose, at the rate of
one dollar a day for every three men. Further, as regarded the
time necessary, he thought it would require from thirty to forty
days to provide five thousand logs. Coals were to be had at
West Bay, of course imported from England, but only at the
enormous rate of about £6 sterling per ton.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>Princes' Island is being greatly benefited already by the demand
for its wood. Land is, in consequence, being cleared and
planted, and the coffee grown there is of good quality, and cheap.
In fact, from its position and capabilities, it is likely to become
a place of great resort, as steam communication, viâ the Cape
of Good Hope, gradually becomes more extended.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned here, that ships sailing much along the
coast are pretty sure to get their bottoms covered with large
barnacles; and the Nemesis, so far from being exempt from this
annoyance, being entirely of iron, was, perhaps, more troubled
with them than a coppered ship would have been. The quantity,
in fact, was enormous, and they adhered so firmly, that it was
with some difficulty they were taken off, commonly bringing
away the paint with them. Kroomen belonging to the men-of-war
were employed to dive under the ship's bottom for the purpose,
and a very curious and amusing scene it was. It is quite
astonishing how long these men can remain at work under
water, and no light work either. Great, muscular, black, curly-headed
fellows, bobbing down under water, some with brooms,
some with scrapers, and others with bits of iron bar; anything, in
short, with which they could attack the tenacious visiters which
clung so lovingly to the iron Nemesis. The Kroomen are an
active, laborious, and faithful race, as all will testify who have
occasion to employ them on the coast. They are received as
seamen in our men-of-war upon the station; and, on her return
to Calcutta, after long and arduous service, the Nemesis had still
two of them remaining on board, out of three who accompanied
her from the coast, the other having died in the service.</p>

<p>At length, on the 22nd of May, the steam was once more got
up, boats hoisted in, anchor weighed, and the word "full speed"
being passed below, away went the still mysterious Nemesis, as
the sun had just dipped below the horizon. Her course would
necessarily lead her towards the island of St Thomas's, another
Portuguese settlement, lying as nearly as possible under the
Line, and, therefore, scarcely a day's voyage from Princes' Island.
She accordingly approached it on the following afternoon, and
did not lose the opportunity of entering the Bay of Chaves,
where lies the principal town, called St. Anne de Chaves.</p>

<p>Some parts of this small island are very pretty and picturesque,
others are wild and thickly wooded. It produces large quantities
of fruit and vegetables, but is principally valuable on account of
the excellence of its coffee, which, however, is not cultivated in
very large quantity. St Anne, the principal town, lies at the
bottom of a lovely bay. The greater part of the inhabitants of
St. Anne are negro slaves and Kroomen. The latter come over
from the coast to the northward of the Line, and are tall, athletic
men, very industrious, (in this respect different from most other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Africans,) intelligent, and, when well treated, faithful and honest.
All the Kroomen are strongly attached to the English, and willingly
serve on board our ships. They have great faith in an
Englishman's word, and, to whatever part of the world they may
be carried, they always feel confident of being sent back to their
own country free of expense, whenever their services are no
longer required. They are an independent people, and have
never been connected with slave-dealers, whom, indeed, they
seem to hold in great contempt. Nevertheless, they have the
woolly hair and thick lips and nose of the true negro. Of all
the Africans whom I have seen, they appear most to resemble
the Abyssinians in their character and habits, though improved
by more frequent contact with our countrymen.</p>

<p>The governor's house is the best in the place, and is distinguished
from the more humble ones around it by the luxury of
a green verandah. Across the entrance to the principal apartment,
a large curtain or screen of drapery was hung, richly
emblazoned with the arms of Portugal, and almost the only real
token of her power.</p>

<p>It was naturally a matter of curiosity to visit his Excellency in
state, and, accordingly, Captain Hall and his officers were
ushered into the <i>presence</i> by a grand Master of the Ceremonies,
who was also commandant of the island. This person was a
huge black negro, "richly caparisoned" for the occasion, and, as
he spoke a little English, he proceeded, immediately after the
presentation, to expound to his Excellency the object of the visit.
That object was, first, of course, to pay respect to so distinguished
an officer, and next, to ascertain whether, in case a steamer should
happen to touch there at any other time, a depôt for coal could be
formed on the island, and whether wood could be procured for
fuel, and a proper place provided for storing it until required.
His Excellency condescended to be extremely polite, saying that
both these matters could be accomplished, and that he should be
happy to lend his assistance in any manner he could. He added
that he perfectly well remembered that the Enterprise, a wooden
steamer, had touched there on her way to India many years
before, but that he had never till now heard of an <i>iron</i> one.</p>

<p>The interview was soon ended, and was so far perfectly satisfactory.
But, as the party were on the way down to the ship
again, the black master of the ceremonies, aide-de-camp, commandant,
&amp;c., made a particular request that no salute should be
fired, for that they happened to be "very badly off for powder"
themselves, and should find it inconvenient to be obliged to
return it; probably a gentle hint that a little powder would be
acceptable.</p>

<p>Little time could be devoted to the further examination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
island, which would seem to be of very small value to its masters.
There is reason, however, to believe, that to a certain degree,
although unacknowledged and in secret, it is made use of as a
sort of intermediate trading-place for slaves.</p>

<p>It was on this island that the distinguished Major Sabine conducted
his scientific and interesting observations upon the
swinging of the pendulum in 1822, as it lies as nearly as possible
under the Line.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the 25th, the Nemesis crossed the
Line, with the thermometer at 96°, which had been the average
temperature for several days. Strong adverse winds prevailed,
with a heavy swell for many days afterwards, against which
she went ahead very steadily, at the rate of five to five and
a half knots an hour; but, as it was desirable to save fuel
as much as possible, it was at length determined to make a
hitherto untried experiment&mdash;viz., to work the lee paddle-wheel
only, while under sail, (the other wheel being disconnected, and
allowed to revolve by the motion of the vessel,) and also to use
only one boiler. She was steered about five and a half points
from the wind, and in this position, with a rolling sea and steady
breeze, she continued to make head at the rate of six and a half
to seven knots an hour, the active or lee paddle-wheel making
twelve to fifteen revolutions per minute. Thus the success of
the trial was complete, particularly as it appeared to counteract
the <i>lee-way</i> of the vessel. The helm did not seem to be materially
affected by the unequal force applied to the two sides of the
vessel.</p>

<p>Some pains have been taken to ascertain whether <i>both</i> engines
could be worked to any good purpose with one boiler. In reply
to this question, it appears that, except in the river Mersey, at
Liverpool, with all circumstances particularly favourable, the
Nemesis was never able to work both engines with one boiler
with more than very inconsiderable effect. But it must be very
evident that any vessel, having power enough to do so in case
of emergency, must possess a great advantage; and there is little
doubt that, with twenty or thirty horse power more, she would
have been able to accomplish it in smooth water, particularly
with sails set. It is therefore to be regretted that her power
(only one hundred and twenty horse) was scarcely sufficient for
her size and weight.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June, the ship all at once seemed to be lost to
the control of the helmsman, and, no other very good reason
suggesting itself, the rudder was naturally examined with care.
It was at once discovered that the drop or false rudder had been
carried away, but by what means did not sufficiently appear,
except that, on examination, there was reason to think it must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
been fairly worn through at the point of junction with the lower
edge of the upper or true rudder&mdash;for at this part nearly the
whole strain of its action operated.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost in attempting to repair this injury, as
the vessel became almost unmanageable, the true rudder, at times,
being nearly above water, in the heavy pitching of the ship.
With the utmost exertion on the part of the officers and the intelligent
carpenter of the ship, a temporary false rudder was constructed,
and securely fixed before nightfall. It was, moreover,
found to act even better than the original one, having more hold
in the water, as well as a larger surface of attachment to the
upper rudder. Subjoined is a plan of this contrivance, which
will almost suffice to explain its ingenuity. It was made of
planks of wood, instead of solid iron, and was secured by chains,
in such a manner as to grasp the upper or true rudder firmly,
while it could also be raised or lowered at pleasure.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus was found to answer remarkably well,
and, during the remainder of the voyage to the Cape, (and that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
trying one,) it never got out of order, or required additional
support. Indeed, it was remarked by every one, that the vessel
was more easily steered than it had been before.</p>

<p>But the difficulties which the Nemesis had to encounter were
not yet ended. Strong breezes from the southward still prevailed,
without any prospect of a speedy change; her progress
was slow, and there only remained on board thirty-two tons of
coal, with a little wood; nor was there any place at hand to
which she could run for fuel. It was therefore resolved to
stand out to sea, trusting to her canvas only. Thus her remaining
fuel would be reserved for any emergency, and would
suffice to ensure her being able to get into port when within a
reasonable distance. A reference to the map will shew her
position at this time.</p>

<p>As much sail was set as she could carry, and her course was
altered according to the wind. Away stood the fearless Nemesis,
disdaining the land, and boldly venturing out to dare the stormy
seas of those regions in the depth of winter. The heavy winds
from the southward, which had so long prevailed, had baffled all
the usual calculations.</p>

<p>On the first day of their standing away, it became more than
ever apparent that, being very light, and in fact scarcely drawing
five feet and a half of water, as she was really flat-bottomed, the
vessel fell so much to leeward, that she made very little progress
on a wind and in a heavy sea; and, in short, that her deep moveable
keels were far from sufficient to counteract this tendency.
It therefore became of the utmost importance to endeavour
to invent some additional means of remedying this inconvenience.</p>

<p>Calling to mind his former experience on the coast of Holland,
and remembering the great advantage which the flat-bottomed
Dutch vessels derive from the use of their lee-boards, when sailing
in light winds or close hauled, with a head sea, it occurred to
the commander that something of a similar kind might be
adopted on the present occasion. The officers concurred in this
suggestion; and when all are animated with the same cordial and
enterprising spirit, few things are found to be so difficult as they
at first appear. It is the mutual reliance upon each other, in
the moment of difficulty, which enables British seamen boldly
and successfully to brave many perils which a moment's doubt
or hesitation might render insurmountable.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The above diagram will sufficiently explain the nature of the
contrivance adopted on this occasion, without the assistance of
minute and tedious description. It is only necessary to remark,
that in addition to the four chains which are seen in the plan, a
fifth was found necessary, to keep the lee-board close to the side
of the vessel. It was secured to the lower end of the lee-board
at its centre, and, having then been carried across the vessel's
bottom, was fastened to the opposite side by a rope and tackle.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, the Nemesis proceeded on her voyage, and
was found to derive great assistance from this new contrivance.
It was found that her lee-way was reduced <i>fully one-half</i>, as
ascertained by careful observation.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
</p>

<p>Gradually the breeze freshened on the subsequent days,
until, at last, about the 18th, it amounted to a moderate gale,
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> that high and heavy sea which all who have visited the Cape
will long remember, threatening, every now and then, to break
on board or poop the ship; but the steady little vessel rose to it
like a swan, and never shipped one heavy or dangerous sea.</p>

<p>Confidence in all her qualities daily increased, and, with a
strong breeze on the quarter, she was now sailing, under canvas
only, at the rate of eight to nine and a half knots an hour. The
lee-board was found at all times useful in making the ship
stanch under sail, but as it was constructed in haste, and only
with such materials as were at hand, it required to be repaired
and strengthened several times.</p>

<p>At length, on the 29th, being still two hundred and thirty
miles from the Cape, but well down to the southward, and it
appearing that there was sufficient fuel left to carry her into
port, the steam was for the last time got up. On the morning
of the 1st July, the remarkable land of the Table Mountain, and
the conical peak to the southward of it, were well in sight. The
Nemesis had made a long and tiresome voyage in the most unfavourable
season of the year, and the anxiety which had been
shared by all on board may well be conceived. The dangers of
the Cape, at that time of year, have not been exaggerated. On
the 1st July, much to the astonishment of every one at Cape
Town, she was descried, late in the evening, quietly steaming
into Table Bay.</p>

according to the model of the Nemesis should be sent to sea upon a long and
uncertain voyage, without having a <i>fixed keel</i> running the whole way fore and aft, and
bolted strongly through her bottom. This would be found of the greatest possible
utility at sea, and it could easily be taken off, and the moveable keels put on, whenever
the vessel were employed on a coast, or in river navigation.
</p>
<p>
It may further be questionable, in the event of a smaller steamer being intended to
be sent out, whether it would not be both safer and less expensive to send it <i>in pieces</i>,
and have it put together, by the mechanics and engineers belonging to it, at the place
where it might be destined for use, than to send it ready equipped, to make its own way
to its destination by steam and canvas, with all the necessary risk.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>During the winter season, few vessels, and those only of light
burden, venture into Table Bay, exposed as it is to the full fury
of the north-west gales. But the Nemesis had little cause for
fear; her light draught of water enabling her to anchor in a well-sheltered
cove, near the stone jetty which has recently been
constructed.</p>

<p>On the second day after her arrival, the governor of the
colony paid a visit on board, and, as he appeared to take the
greatest interest in all that related to her construction and
equipment, the steam was got up, and the whole party were
carried round the bay, apparently much to their satisfaction and
enjoyment. The foremost gun was fired in every position, and
with different charges of powder, to shew its power and range;
and the interest awakened as to the future destination of the
vessel was much increased by what they then witnessed.</p>

<p>Everything contributed to make the day remembered; and as
the Nemesis, returning from her trip, approached the landing-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
thousands came to greet her. To the astonishment of all,
she ran in close to the side of the <i>old</i> jetty, where no vessel had
ever been seen before. Nothing could exceed the wonder of the
people at seeing so long and large a vessel floating alongside
their old wooden pier, usually frequented only by boats. It
created quite an excitement in quiet Cape Town, and the steady,
sober-thinking Dutchmen could hardly bring themselves to
believe that iron would float at all, and still less with such
astonishing buoyancy.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the governor and his suite landed, when hundreds,
one might almost say thousands, of curious people crowded on
board. The report that an iron steamer was lying close to the
town had spread so fast, and had excited so much curiosity, that
even the sick made it an excuse for an airing; and such a motley
crowd of people of every caste and colour as gathered round the
vessel is rarely to be met with elsewhere. The negro, the
Hottentot, the Caffir, and the Malay, with all the intermediate
shades of colour, hastened down with idle curiosity; while the
respectable Europeans and colonists, young and old, were admitted
on board, and seemed delighted to gaze on something
new.</p>

<p>As it was desirable that as much coal as possible should be
taken on board before the vessel was compelled to haul off,
owing to the falling of the tide, no time was lost in commencing
the troublesome process. Even this did not at all deter the
visiters, who continued to succeed each other in crowds, in spite
of the inconvenience they suffered.</p>

<p>Several repairs were now to be made with all expedition. The
drop, or false rudder, was first to be restored, and required to be
much strengthened. This was a very essential matter; and a
suggestion now occurred worth noticing, namely, that in the
event of other vessels of the same description being sent to sea,
they should be provided with some means of being able completely
to choke the rudder temporarily, or prevent its action
altogether, while at sea, in case of its being found requisite to
repair the drop-rudder. The want of some means of keeping
the rudder stationary while repairing it at sea was frequently felt,
and something might easily be provided to effect this object.
The whole delay at the Cape amounted to nine clear days.</p>

<p>On the 11th of July, all being completed, she once more stood
out of Table Bay, with the cheers and hearty good wishes of all
for her success, although they wondered what her mysterious
destination could be.</p>

<p>It is evident that a steamer bound to Singapore, or to any
place still further eastward, would have a choice of three routes;
either she might make her passage from the Cape towards the
Straits of Sunda, between the islands of Java and Sumatra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
trusting principally to her sails, the winds being generally strong
in those latitudes, and thereby saving her fuel; or she might
run from the Cape up to the Mauritius, to take in coal, which
has been done by many steamers, and thence proceed by the
Straits of Malacca; or, lastly, she might run through the
Mozambique Channel, between the continent of Africa and the
island of Madagascar, and, touching at Ceylon for coals, proceed
likewise down the Straits of Malacca to her destination.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, the Nemesis had distinct orders to
choose the latter route, the season of the year being considered
the most favourable for it, and it being thought desirable that a
visit should be paid to the island of Johanna, the most frequented
of the group called the Comoro Islands, situated at the northern
end of the Mozambique Channel. This island will be more particularly
alluded to in its proper place. Thence she was to proceed
direct to Ceylon for coals. But even this was only known to her
commander; and all that either officers or men could learn about
her destination, when they left the Cape, was, that they were at
once to proceed through the Mozambique Channel, but with
what object they knew not.</p>

<p>The Nemesis now approaches to one of the most eventful
periods of her history. Six days had scarcely passed since her
departure from the Cape, when a new and quite unforeseen
danger awaited her, and threatened the most appalling consequences,
without any port being at hand for refuge. It has very
rarely happened that a ship has been so near destruction, and
yet escaped at last. The first few days of her passage alternated
between gales and calms, and the high sea which she encountered
only gave her a further opportunity of proving the good qualities
which she possessed as a sea-boat. Cape Francis, on the southern
side of the coast of Africa, within the colony, near Algoa Bay, was
in sight from the mast-head on the 14th. The barometer began
to fall on the 15th, and at length, on the following day, had
almost sunk to twenty-eight inches. Vivid flashes of lightning
now ran along the sky to the westward; the wind, which had
been strong and steady from the N.N.W., freshened to a heavy
gale; every appearance threatened an increase rather than a
diminution of the storm; and the sea became so high and heavy,
that it threatened every moment to overwhelm the <i>long</i>, <i>low</i>
Nemesis, for the sail that could be put upon her scarcely sufficed
to keep her before the sea.</p>

<p>The float-boards had been taken off the wheels before the
gale commenced, and she had continued under canvas ever
since. Algoa Bay had been passed long before the weather
had become so threatening; to return to it was now impossible;
the gale went on increasing, the sea rose fearfully, and the ship's
course was slightly altered, so as to carry her further away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the land. Her danger even at this time was great, as she lay so
low upon the sea, which heaved its convulsive waves high above
her.</p>

<p>In the night, or rather about three o'clock in the morning of
the 17th, a tremendous sea at length struck her upon the larboard
quarter. Her whole frame quivered with the blow; and
so violent was the shock, that the first impression of all on board
was, that the ship had been actually riven asunder. The violence
of the blow made her broach to the sea and wind; but, happily,
she was got before it again as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>As daylight dawned, the injuries which the vessel had received
were soon discovered. The starboard paddle-wheel had been
seriously damaged; in fact, a considerable portion of it had been
nearly carried away, and only hung by a very small attachment,
by which it was then dragging through the water.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the necessary means been adopted to save this
portion of the wheel, when another and more serious injury was
found to have happened to the body of the ship itself. An immense
perpendicular crack was discovered, on both sides of the
vessel, just before the after paddle or sponson beam, extending
almost entirely through the second iron plate from the top, and
also through a small portion of the upper one. These had been
broken asunder with such violence, that, at the worst point of
the injury, the plate had bulged outwards in such a manner, that
one portion of the broken surface projected to the extent of about
two inches, leaving a most formidable opening in the ship's side.
In reality, the vessel had begun to separate amidships, from one
side to the other. There was every probability, too, that the
crack, which at this time was nearly two feet and a half in length,
would rapidly extend itself by the working of the ship, unless the
weather moderated very speedily. There was every cause for
alarm, and little prospect of being able, even temporarily, to
repair so serious an injury in the then state of the weather.</p>

<p>It was evident that the broken paddle-wheel could not long
hold together, and scarcely any one thought it possible to save
the broken portion of it from being lost. But a little ingenuity,
stimulated by the necessity of the moment, often suggests the
most effectual contrivances, which are, after all, the most simple.
The great object was to secure it temporarily in some way or
other; so that, as soon as the rim became completely broken
through, the mass might hang suspended by some other means
from the ship's side. The vessel was rolling heavily, so that
there was little chance of being able to pass a rope round it;
but the ingenious thought quickly suggested itself, that one of
the large boat-anchors would make a capital fish-hook for the
purpose. With this, one of the arms was at last caught hold of,
and supported, until the rim was completely torn through; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
then, by means of a tackle, the large broken portion of the wheel
was, with some difficulty, hauled on board.</p>

<p>So far there had been good fortune in the midst of trouble,
for, had this portion of the wheel been entirely lost, there is
good reason to fear, as will presently be seen, that with only one
wheel, which might also have easily become injured, the unfortunate
Nemesis would very probably have been unable to outlive
the still worse weather which she afterwards encountered, and
would have scarcely reached a port, even in a sinking state.</p>

<p>And here we may make two observations. First, that the
practice of taking off the float-boards under sail, which, in some
steamers, is made a regular exercise for the men, at all times
materially weakens the paddle-wheel, particularly in a heavy sea,
and may endanger it altogether. Secondly, that an additional
paddle-ring, running round the centre of the paddle-arms, and
tying them together, contributes very much to the strength of
the wheel; and further, that the paddle-centre should never be
made of cast iron. It is the most important part of the whole
wheel, and should have the utmost strength, which wrought iron
alone can give it. It should here be mentioned, that even on
this occasion eight only, out of the sixteen float-boards, had
been removed, otherwise very probably still more serious damage
would have happened. In order to provide against the recurrence
of any similar accident, orders were subsequently given,
to prepare several small bars of iron, which were to be screwed
on in the place of every <i>second</i> float-board removed; so that, if
eight float-boards were taken off, four small bars of iron would
be put on in their places. Thus the wheel would not lose its
proper support and connexion. But, from the experience which
had now been gained, it was rarely afterwards thought expedient
to take the float-boards off at all, and certainly only in smooth
water, and with every appearance of settled weather. The
portion of the paddle-wheel which had been torn away on
this occasion comprised no less than two-fifths of the entire
circumference of the wheel. This large mass of iron could not
have weighed less than fifteen to sixteen cwt.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 18th, the weather moderated considerably,
and the vessel proceeded, with the help of one wheel
only, at the rate of about four knots an hour. In the meantime,
every possible effort was used to get the broken wheel
repaired; and, in the short space of three days after the accident,
the broken portion was got over the vessel's side with
extraordinary labour, and was ultimately secured by bolts in its
original place.</p>

<p>On the 20th, she passed within forty miles of Port Natal,
(become so famous as the place the eminent Dutch farmers,
from the Cape Colony, have attempted to make independent.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
But there was little chance of being able to make the necessary
repairs in such a place.</p>

<p>The dangerous condition of the vessel, after the iron plates on
both sides had begun to open, could be concealed from none on
board; but, as long as the weather was moderate, there appeared
little doubt of her being able to reach Delagoa Bay without very
great risk of foundering. On the following day, however, the
21st, the wind again began to freshen from the north-east, an
unusual quarter at that time of the year. Again the mighty sea
arose, and damped the reviving hopes of all, and the heavy cross
swell could be looked on only with deep alarm.</p>

<p>Gradually, the opening in the ship's sides, which hitherto had
been sufficiently limited to cause her to take in but little water,
began to extend itself in an alarming manner. Indeed, it was
impossible to guess where it would stop, or how any efficient
means could be adopted to check it. Both sides were so bad
that it was difficult to say which was worst. The vessel was
evidently <i>working</i> amidships, as it is called; or, in other words,
it had not only opened up and down, but was moving in and out
from side to side. Moreover, the weather threatened to become
rather worse than better; and, to add to the difficulty, the furnace
of the larboard boiler was now found to be likewise injured, and,
in fact, could scarcely be used at all. Thus it became more and
more uncertain whether the engines could be kept working, so as
to pump the water out of the hold; to say nothing of urging the
vessel along.</p>

<p>Temporary expedients were at once to be resorted to; repairs
were wanted at various parts at the same time, and every hand
on board was now to be occupied day and night in contriving
means to keep the vessel afloat. The heavy sea which, since the
change of wind, had met the full current, and rolled heavily
behind the vessel, threatened to break over her every instant.
To provide as well as possible against this danger, four breadths
of stout plank were secured, as strongly as possible, over the
stern and along the quarters, in order to keep the sea out, or at
all events to break its force. So heavy was the sea, that at this
time the main rudder was sometimes completely out of water,
and at the same moment the jib-boom was <i>under</i> it.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, with the hope of relieving the strain, by
diminishing the top weight at the extremities, the aftermost or
large stern gun was with great labour dismounted from its pivot-carriage,
and safely deposited in one of the after coal-bunkers;
and the bower anchors, which had already been brought inboard,
were now dragged further amidships. This eased the
ship a little. But gradually as the day advanced, the wind increased,
and hourly the sea became more dangerous.</p>

<p>An attempt was, however, made on the 22nd to effect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
temporary repair to the ship's sides, which were straining very
much. For this purpose, two or three rivets were cut out on
each side of the crack in the plates, and a portion of a new iron
plate was with difficulty fixed on the outside, upon the worst
part, and bolted through into a piece of stout oak plank, placed
across it on the inside. The openings had by this time extended
downwards <i>more than three feet and a half</i> on both sides of
the vessel.</p>

<p>They were, at this time, at no great distance from Cape Vidal;
but a tremendous current was setting to the south-west, at the
rate of more than fifty miles a day, and helped to throw up a
very heavy, dangerous sea. At length the morning dawned
once more, and, as the day advanced, the north-east gale had
moderated; and gradually it declined, until, in the afternoon,
the wind changed round towards the south-east. The repairs to
the damaged wheel were by this time completed, and although
the injury to the ship's sides was hourly increasing, the hopes of
all on board redoubled as they saw the double power of both
wheels once more at work. But Delagoa Bay, for which they
struggled still so hard, was not less than two hundred miles
distant. As night closed in again, the angry wind began to
howl, and burst upon the fated bark in heavy gusts and squalls.
And all around was dark and solemn, as the fate which seemed
again to threaten misery and destruction.</p>

<p>The only sail she now carried was torn away in shreds, and
the steam itself had little power to stand the fury of the winds
and waves. At length it lulled: again she moved, and yet
again the mighty storm increased, and with alternate hopes and
fears the morning's dawn was looked for. She heaved and
strained most fearfully, the leaks increased, the <i>openings spread</i>,
and yet she floated. 'Twas hoped that, as the day advanced, the
storm would yield; but hour after hour, as it passed, had
brought no sign of change or promise of amendment. Their
danger was at this time imminent; but it became so evident
to all that the only chance of safety lay in using unremitting
exertions, and labouring day and night with hearty good-will,
that their very efforts produced confidence, which, in its turn,
redoubled all their strength. Nevertheless, it seemed as if new
dangers were constantly in store.</p>

<p>The leaks continued to increase, her sides strained and opened
fearfully, and the apertures had by this time extended upwards
completely to the deck, and downwards far below the water-line.
As the vessel heaved and rolled from side to side, the broken
edges of the iron plates sometimes opened to the extent of an
inch, while their lateral motion, as the vessel worked, in the part
that had bulged, was frequently not less than <i>five inches</i>. As
the storm increased, it was found that in the short space of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and a half hours, and in spite of every exertion to strengthen
the part, the openings on both sides had further increased in
length no less than eighteen inches.</p>

<p>The motion of the vessel, in such a pitching cross sea, was
very quick; and every time the sides opened, the rush of wind
and water through them was terrific. Luckily, the engines were
still able to work, and continued to pump the water out very fast,
although the openings were actually close to the engine-room
itself. But the dangerous state of the vessel was appalling, not
only from the fear of her separating amidships, but from the
chance of the bilge-pumps becoming choked, or the fires being
put out by the rush of water.</p>

<p>The struggle was evidently to be one for life or death. She
groaned and worked tremendously, and reports were brought in
quick succession from different parts of the vessel, that she was
fast breaking up in pieces.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, it was still necessary to inspire the drooping
spirits of the men with some new exertion. The captain tried to
smile, and, by a cool, collected manner, sought to awaken hope
which in secret he himself could scarcely feel. "You may smile,
sir," said one of the sturdiest of the men, a hardy boiler-maker
by trade, "but you don't know the nature of iron; how should
you!" (as if in pity of his ignorance,) and then added, as if for
comfort, "Ah, sir, when once it works and cracks, as our sides
are doing now, it's sure to go on; nothing can stop it."</p>

<p>However, it was evident that talking about it would not mend
the matter, and all that could be said was, "The greater our
danger, the more must our exertions be increased to counteract
it." And increased they were. Every officer and man set-to
again in earnest, to try to keep the ship together. One party
was employed to nail down thick planks and spars upon the
deck, fore and aft, over the broken part of the ship; others were
busy bolting the ends of them into the sponson-beams, between
the paddle-boxes; while another party, engineers and firemen,
were busy strengthening the ship's sides below.</p>

<p>To understand this latter part of the condition of affairs, it
must be explained that, what in a wooden ship would be called
the ribs, are, in an iron one, called the "angle-irons." They
are, in fact, strong angular bars, extending up and down the
ship's sides like ribs, having a flat surface, to which the plates of
iron are bolted. These angle-irons, or ribs, are seventeen inches
distant from each other, and at about the centre, between two of
them, the crack had taken place in the plates of iron. The
accident had occurred precisely in the weakest part of the vessel,
amidships; and it would seem probable that, as there was a
heavy cross sea in the Mozambique Channel when the misfortune
happened, the head of the vessel was held firm in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hollow of one sea at the moment the top of another sea struck
her heavily on the quarter. It made her frame quiver; and her
length and shallowness rendered her the more liable to suffer
injury from a similar blow.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>As regards the temporary repairs, it was evident that two contrivances
were necessary for holding the broken plate together in
its proper position. In the first place, small blocks of wood were
fixed across between the angle-irons from one to the other, in
such a manner that they crossed each other like the letter X,
and gave support against the working of the ship, and the
tendency of the plates to overlap each other. Next, strong bolts
or bars of iron were passed <i>through</i> the angle-irons from one to
the other, and tightened by means of a nut and screw at their
extremities. By these means, the angle-irons, being now strongly
connected together, were made to hold the edges of the broken
plates in contact between them, which, as long as the bolts held
good, would be quite sufficient as a temporary repair. But all
these contrivances were adopted with extreme difficulty, and
during a gale of wind, when all attempts of the kind appeared
desperate. Fortunately, towards morning of the next day, the
26th, the gale slightly moderated; and these repairs being now
completed as well as circumstances would permit, rendered her
in all respects stronger, so that she strained much less than before.</p>

<p>By this time the land was not far distant, and the hopes of
those who had most despaired revived again. By degrees the
haze began to clear; and now what new sensations crowded in
the anxious mind! what thrills of joyous gratitude, as the straining
eye first caught the doubtful land! The heavy sea had
gradually diminished as the Nemesis approached the coast, and
she at length ran into smooth water, near a bold cape. Never
was the sound of the running out of a cable after an almost
hopeless voyage heard with greater joy than on this occasion.
She was now safe at last, and rescued from an almost desperate
fate. Congratulations were mutual; and it may well be said
that those who toil and share their fears and hopes together
become more firmly bound in sympathy and friendship.</p>

<p>The anchorage which the Nemesis had now so providentially
reached was situated close to Cape Inyache, at the entrance of
Delagoa Bay. This settlement, which still belongs to the Portuguese,
was once famous in the annals of slavery, as one of the
principal marts in which that revolting traffic was carried on. It
is still far from being undeserving of the stigma which attaches
to its name, although it has greatly fallen from its once thriving
condition. It is situated on the eastern coast of Africa, (see
map,) and at daylight, on the morning of the 27th July, 1840,
the Nemesis steamed into the river which runs into the bay, and
is known by the name of English River.</p>

<p>The Portuguese have a small fort near its entrance, from
which the approach of the steamer was no sooner discovered
than a mighty stir was made. Steamers had scarcely even been
heard of, much less seen. The object of her visit none could
guess; but all were conscious of partaking more or less in both
the sins and the profits of the slave-trade; and, therefore, all
regarded the approaching vessel as no friendly visiter. Guns
were made to bear, ammunition was got into readiness, and
everything would have looked very formidable had it not been
fully known that a single shot from the stern gun of the Nemesis
would have made the walls tremble, and the defenders hide
themselves.</p>

<p>The Nemesis being uncertain whether her reception would be
friendly or otherwise, slowly passed up beyond the fort, to
explore the river, and great was the surprise of all the lookers-on,
to see her move so easily through water so shallow, that they
thought it could scarcely float one of their smallest slavers. They
had little dreamed that so large a vessel could, if necessary,
pursue even the boats of the slavers into their most secret
haunts.</p>

<p>As she again descended and approached the fort, there was
evidently some excitement, as if they doubted what would happen
next.</p>

<p>An aide-de-camp soon came on board from the governor of the
fort, to inquire whence the vessel came, and what her object might
be in visiting such an unfrequented place; but neither he nor
any one on board could make each other understood.</p>

<p>On the same day, the captain and some of the officers of the
Nemesis went on shore, to pay their respects to his Excellency,
who affected to be exceedingly glad to see them, and shewed them
all possible civility and attention. This was, no doubt, politic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
on his part, for he had every reason to believe that the Nemesis
was a man-of-war, and he also well knew, that had she been so,
it would have been a difficult matter for him to exculpate himself
from the charge of openly aiding and abetting the slave-trade,
which was at that very moment being carried on under his own
eyes, and within reach of his own guns. It was, moreover, sanctioned
by the very flag flying at the peak of the slavers. Yet
the same flag was hoisted on the fort itself, under the stipulations
of a treaty, by which its exertions were to be used to prevent the
continuance of the horrid traffic in the river. A slaver was, in
fact, lying in the river, not far from the fort, and, as the steamer
was passing up, it was easily observed that the crew were deserting
her, and trying to make good their escape, leaving their craft at
the mercy of a single boat's crew. But the Nemesis was not a
man-of-war, and had no right to capture her; and it was therefore
more politic not to seem to notice, in the first instance, what
was very apparent to all.</p>

<p>For some time, there was a difficulty in communicating with
the governor at all, no one knowing the language; but, at length,
a Parsee merchant was sent for, who could speak Hindostanee as
well as Portuguese, and as there was also a man on board who
could speak Hindostanee, a regular cross-fire conversation was
thus maintained, in a roundabout manner. One would hardly
have expected to find a Parsee merchant settled in such a remote
and unhealthy spot as Delagoa Bay, under the Portuguese
government. But where will not the "auri sacra fames" tempt
mankind to court the smile of Fortune, even with the grin of
Pestilence and Death before them?</p>

<p>As a settlement, Delagoa Bay is of very little use to the Portuguese,
of whom very few reside there; and without the stain of
slavery, it could scarcely linger on. There is, however, a limited
trade in ivory and gold-dust, and the coast is frequented by
whalers, particularly Americans, who come into the settlement
for supplies. The narrative of Captain Owen's survey on the
coast gives a melancholy picture of the deadly nature of the
climate, which very few, either of his officers or his men, were
fortunate enough to survive.</p>

<p>The fact of a slaver lying under the guns of the fort, and other
little evidences that the governor was very backward in carrying
out the instructions he had received respecting the slave-trade,
went hard with him afterwards. This case was mentioned to the
governor of Mozambique, under whose jurisdiction Delagoa Bay
is placed, and by whom the deputy-governor is appointed. It
will hereafter be seen, that <i>he</i> was, at all events, sincere and
energetic in his efforts to stop the trade. He became excessively
angry when the circumstances were stated to him, and declared
that it was in violation of his most strict and positive orders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
instantly directed that the deputy-governor should be removed
from his post.</p>

<p>The slaver, which was a fine Portuguese brig, was subsequently
visited by some of the officers of the Nemesis, and found to be
regularly fitted out for the trade, the planks for the slave-deck
being all ready, with boilers for their food, and shackles, &amp;c.
Her masts and spars were large, and of excellent stuff, and
advantage was soon taken of this circumstance, to procure some
necessary materials for the repairs.</p>

<p>It appeared that there were some excellent timbers lying on
the beach, which had probably belonged to some large ship
wrecked in the neighbourhood. They were precisely such as
would best suit the wants of our vessel; and, as it was stated
that they belonged to a Portuguese merchant in the town, inquiry
was at once made about the purchase of them. Various excuses,
however, were made, and unnecessary difficulty suggested. It
was evident that there was a "screw loose" somewhere or other,
or else that they wished to impose an exorbitant price for them.
A message was therefore immediately sent, declaring that if the
timbers were not given up at a fair valuation, <i>within twenty
minutes</i>, the captain of the Nemesis "would go on board the
slaver with his men, and take the masts and spars out of <i>her</i>,
and as they appeared to be exceedingly good ones, they would
answer her purpose rather better."</p>

<p>No talisman could have acted more instantaneously than this
well-timed threat, which, moreover, would certainly have been
put in execution. The whole community, from the governor
downwards, were more or less interested in the affair; the report
rapidly reached the master of the slaver; his alarm was natural
enough, and his reasons for urging the immediate surrender of
the timbers sufficiently evident. "Pray give them anything in
the world they want," said he; "let me rather pay for it a dozen
times over, than keep that strange-looking ship here. She will
ruin us altogether; we must get rid of her in any way we can;
give her, by all means, everything she wants, and let her be off,
for mercy's sake."</p>

<p>Long before the twenty minutes had expired, the timbers were
given up. The governor himself, on the following day, the 29th
of July, sent a present of some vegetables and ivory on board,
and afterwards came in person to look at the ship, and was, to
all appearance, so pleased with his reception, and doubtless, so
well impressed with the appearance of the vessel, that he stayed to
dinner, and did his best to shew himself a good fellow.</p>

<p>It may here be observed, that the so-called "English River,"
which empties itself into the sea at Delagoa Bay, is, in reality,
the estuary of three rivers, called the Temby, the Dundas, and
the Mattoll. But they are none of them of much importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
considered separately, having their sources at scarcely more than
a good day's journey from the entrance, and forming rather the
drains of a rich, alluvial country, than the outlets of the super-abundant
waters of distant tiers of mountains. They run into
the English River at the distance of little more than five miles
above the fort. Their shores are generally bordered by an
extensive muddy flat, gradually rising towards higher land,
covered with large bushes, but which can hardly be said to be
crowned with luxuriant woods. Nothing can be imagined more
calculated, under a tropical sun, to produce the most deadly
pestilence. No wonder that those who have endeavoured to
trace up these rivers, for even a short distance, have so commonly
fallen victims to their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The entrance to English River, from its breadth and general
appearance, leads you to imagine it of greater importance than it
really is. Yet it is not without something of a picturesque
character; the sand hills covered with calabash trees, and the
aspect of the village and Portuguese Fort, tottering though it be,
all present a refreshing picture, when first viewed, after a long
and dangerous voyage.</p>

<p>The neighbouring country is divided among different tribes,
who are frequently at war with each other, and over whom the
Portuguese have very little control. Their own factory, or fort,
is situated on the north side of the river, in the country of
Mafoomo. But the most warlike and troublesome of all the
tribes are the so-called Hollontontes, living some distance to the
southward, and resembling, or indeed probably a branch of, the
Zooloo Caffirs, of whom we have lately heard so much in connexion
with the unfortunate Dutch emigrant-farmers at Port
Natal. These Hollontontes (probably a corruption from Hottentots)
have, on more than one occasion, made themselves formidable,
even to the Portuguese themselves.</p>

<p>On the 31st, the Nemesis was hauled on shore on the fine
sandy beach near the fort, and, in fact, within range of its guns.</p>

<p>It was on this day that a remarkable phenomenon occurred,
which is here worth mentioning; the more particularly as it was
followed at night and during the subsequent day by a very
heavy gale of wind, whose approach it might, in a manner, be
said to have indicated. This was, in fact, the seventh<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> great
plague of Egypt, the plague of locusts, which filled the atmosphere
in myriads, as far as the eye could reach on every side;
and indeed much further, for, during the time it lasted, the very
sky was darkened, and the whole air was filled with a sound as
of "a mighty rushing wind," by the flapping of their wings.
You could scarcely open either your eyes or your mouth, without
fear of being blinded or choked by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, the visitation did not last long enough to commit
extensive destruction, but it was nevertheless a source of great
alarm and inconvenience. In some parts of China, also, the
swarms of locusts occasionally produce a great deal of mischief,
and are very naturally dreaded, both by the people and the
government. But those visitations are not so severe as this was,
during the short time it lasted.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Large quantities of locusts were collected by the natives for
food; and it was a very curious sight, for two or three days
afterwards, to watch the different groups of black men, as nearly
naked as possible, crowding round their fires, with all the eagerness
of hunger, and all the longing of an epicure, to enjoy a
feast of locusts. They stripped off the wings and legs, and
having slightly roasted or grilled them, appeared to find them a
capital luxury, even not unworthy of the dance and song with
which they accompanied their repast.</p>

was curious to ascertain whether there was anything worth noting in relation to the
state of the wind at Delagoa Bay when the locusts appeared, and when they were carried
away again. On referring to the ship's log, I find that the day preceding the appearance
of the locusts was one of perfect calm; but the morning of the day on which they
came was ushered in by a north-east wind, which lasted until the evening, when it
changed round to precisely the opposite quarter&mdash;namely, to the south-west, and increased
on the following day to a strong gale from the same quarter, which carried away
all the locusts. Subsequently, it again veered round to the north-east, and continued
so for several days, but brought no more locusts.</p>

<p>No time was now lost in commencing the repairs of which the
steamer stood so much in need. It will be remembered, that
the structure of the ship's side has been elsewhere described,
and that the angle-irons are, in fact, the ship's ribs. The split
amidships had taken place in the middle of the iron plate,
between the two angle-irons immediately before the after sponson-beam.
It extended downwards full seven feet from the deck on
either side the vessel; and, as the distance from the deck to the
water-line, with a moderate draught of water, is only from three
feet four inches to three feet six inches, it must have extended
under water for about the same distance as it did above. But
the whole <i>semi</i>-circumference of the vessel's hull is only about
twenty-three feet and a half. Therefore, as the crack was full
seven feet in length on each side of the ship, there only remained
sixteen feet on each side of the ship's hull, or about
two-thirds in all, not separated in two.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>In other iron vessels more recently constructed by the same
builder, Mr. Laird, of Birkenhead, it is satisfactory to know that
full provision has been made against the recurrence of any
similar accidents. The Phlegethon, which was afterwards built
upon the same model, has been constructed in such a manner,
by the addition of bulkheads, &amp;c., that not only could there be
no apprehension of the accident, but an almost impossibility of
its recurrence. The accompanying woodcut will explain the
improvement.</p>

(including the passage round the Cape, when she experienced very bad weather), in
as good order as when she left England, never having required any alteration or
strengthening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thing now to be done was evidently to remove the
broken iron plates, and to rivet in new ones in their place. In
order to provide for additional strengthening of the vessel
inside, the large timbers which had been purchased were made
use of, as being exactly adapted for the purpose. Three of these
were placed across the angle-irons against the side of the vessel,
the longest and stoutest, which was twenty-three feet in length,
one foot broad, and six inches thick, being placed highest up,
about two to three feet below the deck. This was secured in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
place by bolts, each a foot long, which were run through the
ship's side, one at the centre of the space between each of the
angle-irons. As there would, however, be a space left between
the face of the beam and the side of the vessel, except at those
points where it rested upon the angle-irons, this interval was
filled up with well-seasoned red pine, which added very much to
the solidity of the contrivance. To "make assurance doubly
sure," two other beams, of the same depth and thickness, but
not of the same length, and secured in a similar manner, were
also employed. By this means, it is very evident that the ship
was made a vast deal stronger than she ever was before, though
not stronger than was proper for her size and shape. The
whole length of the new plates put in the ship's sides was eight
feet two inches; and so effectually was the work done that the
whole of it remained perfect, stringers and all, at the end of two
years and a half of severe and uninterrupted service.</p>

<p>These contrivances added very little to the weight of the
vessel, and gave it very great support in the weakest part, and
just where it was most required, to enable her to carry coals on
deck, &amp;c.</p>

<p>During her detention of twelve days, the Nemesis had been
an object of great curiosity to the native Africans, as well as
to the Portuguese settlers. The chiefs of some of the tribes
were occasionally allowed to look at the vessel, and expressed
the greatest possible astonishment at what they saw. It happened
to be just the time of year when the king of one of the
tribes most friendly to the Portuguese (probably, as it appeared,
because they have large dealings together in slaves) usually came
down from his own country, about thirty miles distant, to pay
his annual visit to the Portuguese governor. On these occasions,
there is a vast attempt on both sides to appear very friendly to
each other, with precisely that degree of sincerity which, as a
<i>minimum</i>, is indispensable to the advantageous barter of slaves
and ivory for iron and spirits, or occasionally gold-dust for
various trifling articles, which in the eyes of a savage possess
inestimable value.</p>

<p>There appears, in general, to be very little good feeling existing
between the native tribes and the Portuguese. The former
look upon the latter with some degree of dread, arising from the
injuries which they have at various times received at their hands;
and the latter regard the former merely as degraded savages, fit
for little else than the speculations of the slave trade. On both
sides there is a degree of mistrust, arising from the debasing
tendency which such a traffic necessarily exercises upon all concerned
in it. In Captain Owens narrative, an instance is related
of the most savage cruelty, exercised by Portuguese Christians
upon a few unarmed and oppressed natives who fell into their
hands, which it is impossible to read without shuddering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>On the present occasion, the native chief who came to do
honour to the governor was a decrepit old man, nearly seventy
years of age, attended by about seven hundred or eight hundred
of his most doughty warriors, partially clothed in skins, and
ornamented with ostrich-feathers stuck in their heads. He himself,
as being a very great man, was clothed in a loose sort of
dressing-gown, with a red nightcap on his head, a present from
the governor himself. Every man had three spears of different
sizes, probably to be thrown at different distances, together with
a stout club and shield; and in the use of these weapons they
exhibited great dexterity.</p>

<p>The governor had invited Captain Hall and his officers to
witness the performance of their war-dance, which was, in reality,
as savage an exhibition as it was possible to conceive.</p>

<p>As evening advanced, the attendants of the old chief were called
upon to drink the governor's health, out of a large <i>tub-full</i> of
rum; and, in order to ensure fair play, a corporal stood by with
a stout cane in his hand, with which he most courageously belaboured
all those who shewed an uncivilized disposition for helping
themselves to more than their share. But the passions of
the savage are not so easily to be subdued; and, if the mere
sight and smell of the liquor had warmed them up into something
like a quarrelsome mood, what was to be expected from the actual
taste and fire of it? Words ran high, and all the threatening
gestures of the excited savage promised even bloodshed; until,
at length, the corporal's stick being insufficient to allay the disturbance,
he very quietly upset the whole remaining contents of
the tub, and soon dispersed the mighty men-of-war, in apparent
reconciliation.</p>

<p>The negro tribes of these parts adopt the practice of tattooing
their faces, but not in that peculiarly neat and regular manner for
which the New Zealanders are distinguished. It is here more
like a rude system of notching the skin, as if done rather to
shew how manfully they can endure pain, than as a mere ornamental
art.</p>

<p>A more sensible practice among some of the tribes about
Delagoa Bay, is that of shaving a large portion of the thick wool
off their heads, tending greatly to cleanliness in a tropical country.
Occasionally it is trimmed into some fanciful shape, like the old
yew-trees in some of our English villages, which stand forth as
curious specimens of nature improved; while, again, the natives
on some parts of the Madagascar coast, generally stout, athletic
men, divide their hair into little tufts all over the head, each of
which is frequently tied round the roots, and thus made to stand
out on all sides in little knobs, giving a very singular appearance
to the head, more particularly when they are seen working side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
by side, as I have often witnessed at the Mauritius, with close-shaved
Indian or Chinese labourers.</p>

<p>As the king above-mentioned and his followers had come from
a considerable distance, and were reported to possess great influence
among their neighbours, it was thought a good opportunity
both to impress them with a knowledge of our power, and to
conciliate them by a show of our good-nature. There was the
more reason for this, in consequence of pretty certain evidence
having been obtained that the crew of an American trading-vessel,
which had been wrecked on the coast not long before,
had been most barbarously treated by the tribe into whose
hands they fell. As such a misfortune might again happen,
it was thought a good opportunity to make an impression
upon the native tribes, which was sure to be communicated from
one to the other, by means of the old king and his adherents.
Accordingly, the old man (who was called Appelli by the Portuguese)
was one day invited to go on board the Nemesis, with one
or two of his attendants. The vessel had by this time been got
nearly ready for sea, and on this occasion, in order to produce
greater effect upon all the lookers-on, was dressed out with her
flags, and, being newly-painted, presented a very gay appearance.
A Portuguese merchant accompanied the veteran chief to the
ship as interpreter, and, rather unexpectedly, several women also
came off with him, dressed in showy colours, and impelled, perhaps,
as much by the flattering thought that they would quite
astonish the white man, as by the mere feeling of curiosity.</p>

<p>The moment the king put his foot upon the deck, the single
fife and drum which was on board set up "God save the king!"
and the old man appeared well pleased both with the tune and the
attention. After this, a particularly ugly, repulsive-looking
fellow, who turned out to be the king's fool, though as old as the
king himself, set up a most discordant note of admiration upon
three reeds which he held in his hand, something after the manner
of pan-pipes. At intervals he treated you to a sort of explanatory
text of his own, in the shape of a few uncouth words, yelled
out in a manner particularly edifying to all <i>except</i> those in whose
honour it is supposed they were especially poured forth. His
appearance was rendered more uncouth by a large bag tied under
his chin, for what purpose was not very evident, but probably to
contain either his charms or his tobacco.</p>

<p>The queen herself had also accompanied her lord upon this
occasion, and exhibited no fear, and certainly no beauty. Picture
to yourself a young sable queen, a capital caricature of one of the
Egyptian statues in black marble, plump and shiny as her prototype,
only less expressive. Then invest her in your imagination
with sundry huge scars about her cheek and nose; not those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
delicate lines and graceful curves which decorate the upper lip of
royalty among New Zealand tribes, but regular lumps, squeezed
up and dried, as it were into large warts, particularly about the
nose, as if a race of gigantic musquitoes had held a feast there!</p>

<p>However, to do justice to the lady's rank, if not to her looks,
Captain Hall thought proper to shew her due attention, and,
accordingly, a glass of wine was offered to her, as well as to her
lord. The old man, though at first suspicious, like all half-savages,
very gladly swallowed it, as soon as one of the officers
had tasted it first. But for the queen wine was not good enough;
rum was the nectar for her&mdash;<i>that</i> was the soul-stirring influence
which could bend her pride, and warm her heart to gentleness.</p>

<p>Having by these means warmed the royal pair to good humour,
the next thing was to bewilder them with astonishment. This
was not difficult. They were requested to examine the ship's
side, and to assure themselves that she was made entirely of iron.
A loud Heugh! was their exclamation. To them it seemed a
boundless mine of wealth, that mass of precious stuff, to purchase
which was all their ambition. They were calculating in their
own minds how many thousands and tens of thousands of slaves
they would have to procure, before they could be able to obtain
so much of the valued metal. But, when the engine was shewn
to them, with all its polished bars, and massive parts, and its
uses partly explained through the interpreter, their astonishment
knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Before the chief's departure, great care was taken to explain
to him the barbarous cruelties which had been committed upon
the shipwrecked seamen by some of the tribes on the coast. He
declared that he had never heard of the occurrence, and affected
to be very much horrified at it. He was made to understand
that he was to communicate to all the people of his tribe, as well
as to all others whom he might fall in with, that, if ever
any injury were done to any white men when driven upon any
part of the coast, an iron vessel, even more terrible than the one
he was then in, would be sent to punish the people. On the
contrary, if he conducted himself peaceably, and treated white
men well on all occasions, he would be considered the friend of
the English, and of all other white men. He was also to make it
publicly known wherever he went, that white men were always
to be treated kindly when in distress. This he promised to do,
with every appearance of sincerity, and upon the whole shewed
more intelligence than might have been expected.</p>

<p>In consideration of the king's promises, and in order the more
fully to gain his influence, a present was made to him, the most
valuable he could have received&mdash;namely, a musket and bayonet,
with its accoutrements. His surprise and delight were beyond
all bounds; he almost seemed to get young again with pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as he grasped the precious weapon in his hands. On leaving
the vessel, he insisted on shaking hands with almost every one
on board.</p>

<p>On the following day, he returned again to the ship in high
glee, bringing with him his own spear and shield, with other
implements of war and of the chase, which he laid at the captain's
feet, as the most valuable presents he could offer to a "faithful
ally."</p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>The circumstances relating to the distressed seamen on the
coast, alluded to in the foregoing chapter, were first stated by one
of the unfortunate sufferers himself, who accosted, in very good
English, some of the officers of the Nemesis, as they were returning
to their ship, and soon proved himself to have belonged
to an American vessel, but stated that he was a native of Hanover.
His name was Samuel Reid, or something very much like it. His
right eye and lower jaw appeared to have been dreadfully wounded,
and gave a practical introduction to the following tale, every part
of which there is too much reason to believe is strictly true.</p>

<p>It appears that an American schooner, called the Colonel
Crockett, of one hundred and forty tons, belonging to Newburgh,
U. S., sailed from New York in the summer of 1839, bound on a
voyage to the West Coast of Africa, to procure bullocks for salting,
principally for the St. Helena market. She subsequently,
also, proceeded to Madagascar, and touched at Delagoa Bay, on
her way to Inhampura River, high up on the east coast, to trade
for ivory. There she remained three weeks, without being able
to accomplish her object. In working out of it again, in May,
1840, she missed stays, and went on shore on the sand at the
river's mouth. They tried in vain to get the vessel off on the
following day, there not being enough men fit for work, as all,
except three out of eleven, were sick with fever. There she lay,
nearly high and dry. It seems they had only one boat remaining,
which was too small to contain all the people, and, therefore, it
was agreed that the captain and second mate, (Samuel Reid,)
with two men, should start off in her, and try to reach Delagoa
Bay, which was only about seventy miles distant, where they
were to procure a larger boat and other assistance, and then
return to bring away the remainder of the crew, and whatever
could be saved from the wreck.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they found the surf beating over the bar at the
mouth of the Inhampura so heavily, that they could not succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in getting the boat out. In this predicament, the captain and
second mate volunteered to set out together, to try to reach
Delagoa Bay by land&mdash;a most hazardous experiment under any
circumstances, with the dangers of the fatal fevers, and the
treachery of the savage native tribes, staring them in the face.
The attempt was, in fact, almost hopeless. Nevertheless, on the
morning of the 9th of May, 1840, they landed from the vessel,
totally unarmed, thinking, probably, that it would be both useless
and laborious for two men to carry arms which they could
scarcely use for more than one or two discharges, owing to the
difficulty of carrying ammunition.</p>

<p>They proceeded for about twenty to twenty-five miles on that
day, without molestation, but were at length joined by three
natives, one of whom left them, under the pretence of going to
procure water, while the other two lighted a fire, and began to
roast some corn, of which they all partook equally. In the
meantime, the native who had been absent returned, bringing
with him seven others.</p>

<p>The captain, being anxious to make the most of his time,
determined to proceed, although the day was fast declining. But,
in order to relieve themselves from the weight of their bags of
clothes which they had each brought with them, they entrusted
them to the care of the natives who followed. On arriving at the
bottom of a steep hill, where there was a picturesque valley, they
all halted for the night, and soon made a capital fire. As might
have been expected, the curiosity of the natives, to say nothing
of their treacherous disposition, could not withstand the temptation
of looking into the bags they had carried, to examine their
contents. This was resisted by the captain, who was rather a
hasty man; a scuffle ensued, and thus the opportunity the
natives sought for was at once afforded them.</p>

<p>Their intentions might have been foreseen the moment the
man left the party, ostensibly to look for water, but in reality to
look for assistance. And although a natural dread of the white
man had hitherto prevented them from openly commencing their
attack&mdash;waiting, probably, for a more favourable opportunity at
nightfall&mdash;a quarrel having once arisen, however trifling, their
savage blood was roused, and all their bad feelings awakened.
They immediately rose in a body, and made a general discharge
of their spears at the two unhappy white men. The captain faced
them boldly, and soon received several severe wounds in front,
and at last tried to save himself by flight. But, wounded as he
was, they soon overtook him, and struck him down, it is to
be hoped, quite dead, although even that does not appear certain.</p>

<p>The mate, on the other hand, who stood sideways to receive
the discharge of spears, presenting a narrower surface than in
front, was wounded with two spears in the right arm, and one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the neighbourhood of the right eye, and, having picked up one of
them, made a furious charge at those who were nearest to him,
and killed two of the savages on the spot. Numbers, however,
necessarily prevailed over the most desperate courage, and he
was at last struck down by a heavy blow of a club over the head,
and, being senseless, was considered dead. They now dragged
him towards the fire, as he afterwards found, and must have
struck him several heavy blows upon different parts of the body.
On coming to himself again, he found that he was stripped of
all his clothes, lying naked upon the sand, and so exhausted
that he could neither speak nor move. Gradually, however, becoming
sensible of his helpless situation, he looked around him,
from time to time, unobserved; and, at length, to his great
horror, discovered the body of his unfortunate captain lying by
the side of the fire, and several natives standing around it, some
of whom were busy cutting off slices from the fleshy parts of the
body, while others roasted them in the fire, with all the appearance
of anxious longing for the feast!</p>

<p>Can any situation be conceived more horrible at this moment
than that of the unfortunate wounded man? If he betrayed
symptoms of life, he was sure to be beaten with heavy clubs to
death; if he lay quiet, to all appearance lifeless, it was far from
improbable that, when they should have become satiated with the
flesh of his companion, they might be ready to commence their
butchery upon himself. Who can picture to himself without
horror the dreadful moments which lingered as they passed, and
seemed endless in the anxiety of suspense! There the poor
fellow lay, in speechless agony, the fated witness of barbarity the
most revolting.</p>

<p>At length, having gorged themselves with that horrible repast
in the peculiar manner which those who have ever seen the
hungry savage at his meal can never forget, they fell asleep
round the fire, under the full oppression of repletion. The poor
mate, perceiving this, made a desperate effort to rouse himself
from his death-like dreaminess, and try to fly from his impending
fate, he knew not how or whither. He could not stand, he
could not walk, and almost feinted with the effort; yet he
crawled on hands and knees towards the neighbouring bush or
thicket, and there contrived to hide himself.</p>

<p>He lay concealed, in helplessness, until the following day,
when he was discovered by the restless eye of the suspicious
savage. He asked, by signs, for water; but not only was that
refused to him, but he was given to understand, without difficulty,
that they looked forward to the pleasure of eating him for their
evening meal with particular satisfaction; and a sort of rude
table was pointed out to him, upon which they intended to cut
him up for their repast, according to their most approved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
fashion. After this, they left him alone in his misery. It
should be mentioned, that when they refused him drink, they
<i>did</i> give him a little food, which they <i>forced</i> him to eat, and&mdash;horrible
to think of!&mdash;it was not improbably a part of his
murdered companion, upon which they had regaled themselves
the evening before.</p>

<p>As night approached, the man, finding himself somewhat
recovered from the shock of his wounds, made another desperate
effort to escape. He could now walk; and slowly and cautiously
he pursued his way, tracing back his course with the almost unerring
instinct which the resolution of despair awakens. The
darkness of the night favoured him; and, by sometimes diving
into the wood for concealment, sometimes resting in the darkest
part of the thicket to collect his failing strength, and then again
boldly urging on his course along the more open beach by the
sea-side, he at length eluded all his pursuers. They had
followed him, for some distance, in vain; and he safely reached,
on the following day, the schooner he had left, completely
exhausted and helpless.</p>

<p>Here he found that, even during his short absence, death had
done its work among his messmates on board. Finding that
there was no hope of procuring relief on shore, another attempt
was made to get the boat over the bar&mdash;and with success. In
this the chief mate, with two other men, embarked, in the hope
of being able to make their passage along the coast of Delagoa
Bay. The attempt fortunately succeeded; and, at the end of
five days, a large boat was descried approaching the wreck,
which had been hired by their comrades from the Portuguese
authorities for two hundred dollars, for the purpose of bringing
them off. But their troubles were not yet destined to end. A
heavy sea still continued to beat upon the bar, creating such a
surf that they were compelled to wait at least fourteen days more
before they could leave the schooner. Happily, they were at
length able to embark; and, carrying with them the most portable
articles of value they could stow away, they ultimately succeeded
in reaching Delagoa Bay.</p>

<p>It has more than once been suspected that some of the tribes
on the eastern coast of Africa were cannibals, under certain circumstances:
but others again, and Captain Owen among the
number, have declared that, "on inquiry, even their greatest
enemies acquitted them of the suspicion." There does not,
however, appear to be any well-grounded reason for calling in
question the truth of the statement made by this unfortunate
man, Reid. His tale was told to Captain Hall with every appearance
of truth; and, although it might be suggested that the
man was not unlikely to have been in a state of dreamy delirium,
after the wounds and blows he had received upon the head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
might have been led by fear to imagine what he pictured to himself
to be true, still this is a very unsatisfactory answer to a
simple tale of facts, artlessly told, and without any object to be
gained by inventing a case of horror. Besides which, he could
hardly have found his way back to the schooner without assistance,
had he not perfectly recovered his senses before he started.</p>

<p>Two of the unfortunate men entered as able seamen on board
the Nemesis, with liberty to be discharged when they pleased,
and continued on board until she arrived at Singapore; but the
second mate preferred waiting for any American vessel that might
touch at the settlement.</p>

<p>It may seem that I have dwelt long upon the subjects of interest
connected with the stay of the Nemesis at Delagoa Bay;
but, in reality, it is a part of the coast of Africa little known to
the general reader, and as the vessel was detained there for a
considerable time, many objects of interest were noticed and remembered.
I have before mentioned that the Portuguese have
been very far from advancing the civilization of the natives.
There is certainly no love for each other between them; and the
debasing influences of the slave-trade seem universally to poison
the heart, and destroy all the sympathies of our nature.</p>

<p>One poor native woman was discovered who spoke English
tolerably well, and was found to have been extremely useful as
interpreter to all the English and American vessels, whalers, and
others, which touched there for supplies. For what particular
reason does not appear, but this woman had been strictly forbidden
by the governor to go on board the Nemesis, under pain of the
severest punishment; indeed, she had been kept in close confinement
nearly ever since the arrival of the vessel. But, at
length, when an American whaler came into the bay, she was
allowed to visit <i>that ship</i> as usual. There was something
peculiarly artless and good-natured about the poor woman's
manner, and she expressed a particular wish to be allowed to
see some person from the English ship. Word was accordingly
brought from the American captain to that effect.</p>

<p>Her tale was a remarkable one, and told with considerable intelligence.
She expressed her attachment to the English in
strong terms, enumerated the various kindnesses she had received
from them, inquired after particular ships and individuals,
and seemed to remember almost every trifling incident that had
occurred. She was greatly afraid of being punished by the
governor for having dared to talk to the English, but could
assign no particular grounds for the harsh treatment she received.
It was, however, shrewdly suspected that it arose from
fear that she might furnish information about the slave-trade,
and that, in fact, her remarks might already have been very
useful to the English cruisers, and, consequently, injurious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the Portuguese dealers. It has been before stated that the
governor himself was not free from the suspicion of countenancing
the traffic; and, taking all the circumstances together, it
became pretty evident that this poor woman's treatment was only
one of the links in the chain of turpitude forged out of the iron
rod of slavery.</p>

<p>For the first time since the arrival of the Nemesis, some of
her officers were now able to leave the ship for a day, and make
an interesting excursion up the river. They started early in the
morning, accompanied by a Portuguese merchant and his
servant. It being now the least unhealthy season of the year,
there was little or no danger to be apprehended from sickness,
particularly as it was not their intention to remain out at night.</p>

<p>It has already been noticed that the English River, is, in fact,
formed by the united waters of three rivers, at the distance of
only five or six miles from the fort, the largest being the Temby,
to the southward, and the smallest the Dundas, to the westward,
while the Mattoll runs up towards the northward. The Dundas
was the one chosen on the present excursion, as there was
good expectation of finding large herds of hippopotami upon its
banks, and perhaps other wild animals, which would furnish a
capital day's sport. The banks of the river were low, and the
stream sluggish, and on all sides abundance of mangrove shrubs
and bushes, sufficient of themselves to indicate that the country
must frequently be flooded. Birds of various kinds, particularly
such as feed upon small fish and worms, were seen in great
numbers, curlews and crows, and occasionally a pelican, with
wild geese and pigeons, and now and then birds of more beautiful
plumage.</p>

<p>As the boat ascended, four wild buffaloes were seen at a
distance, and a beautiful zebra was descried, galloping away
from the river-side. But the most striking objects were the
numerous hippopotami, in the midst of whose favourite haunts
they now found themselves. A more curious or exciting scene
can scarcely be imagined; and when it was resolved to continue
the ascent, in the hope of having some fine sport, the Portuguese
merchant was so alarmed, that he very humbly requested that he
might be left behind. The strange animals opened their huge
mouths, and bellowed forth a sound something like the roar of
an ox in concert with the grunt of a wild boar, with a little
accompaniment of the braying of an ass. They did not at first
seem frightened, but shewed their formidable-looking teeth, as if
they had some right to frighten others. Hundreds of them
started up at different times, some rising from the shallow mud
in which they had been lying, and hastening off with a quick,
heavy tread; others, again, just raising their heads up from the
deeper parts of the river, and diving again like porpoises.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Several of them were fired at and wounded, upon which they
dived instantly out of sight, without rising again. Indeed, they
are hardly ever killed in such a way as to be taken on the spot
at once; but, dying under water, the carcase of course rises to
the surface after two or three days, and is then taken possession
of by the natives. Their flesh is eaten with great avidity in times
of scarcity; but, generally speaking, they are more valued for
the beautiful ivory of their teeth, which are collected and bartered
for various articles of European manufacture.</p>

<p>Several natives were seen paddling about the river in their
little canoes, apparently without any fear of the hippopotami,
and one party of them was spoken to, and appeared harmless
and contented; but their invitation to land and look at the
country was not accepted, as there was little time to spare, and
their treacherous character was sufficiently known to make it imprudent
to divide a small party into still smaller ones. They,
however, explained very intelligibly the mode in which they
contrived to kill the hippopotami&mdash;viz., sometimes by making a
regular charge at some of them, singled out on purpose, with
their spears. To effect this, they go in large numbers together,
but the expedition is attended with considerable danger, and
rarely resorted to, except in times of dearth. A more common
method is to lay traps of various kinds for them, either upon the
banks of the river itself, or among the neighbouring trees, a
party being constantly at hand, in concealment, to despatch them
at the last moment.</p>

<p>The whole distance ascended, from the junction of the Dundas
with the English River was about seven or eight miles, when the
water became so shallow that the boats could scarcely proceed.
Towards evening, therefore, they again descended with the ebb-tide,
having the full light of the moon to guide them down to
their ship, after a laborious but very agreeable day, which fully
repaid them by the interesting objects which presented themselves
to their notice.</p>

<p>Their last day had now arrived; and, with a view to shew them
every possible attention, as well as to conciliate their good
offices, the governor invited Captain Hall and his officers to a
grand entertainment, on which occasion all the delicacies of the
African coast had been sought out to do honour to the guests,
and nothing was omitted which could contribute to the novelty
and perfection of the entertainment.</p>

<p>The exterior of the governor's residence was something like a
good-sized English cottage, consisting of only one floor, as is
commonly the case in hot countries, and having two white pillars
in front, which supported a portion of the roof, serving at the
same time for a verandah. It was ornamented with green
branches for the occasion, affording a very necessary protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
from the glare of the sun, which was still high and powerful.
There were several other smaller cottages disposed around it,
something in the form of a square, but not a single tree or other
relieving object to soften the burning reflection from the deep
sand which formed the site of the fort and of the governor's residence.</p>

<p>The dinner went off with great éclat, and no little amusement
at the original attempts of the black waiters (of course slaves) to
vie with European refinement. Towards evening, when tea had
at length been handed round, the entertainment was concluded
with, "for the last time of performance," a dance of the native
women belonging to the neighbouring village. The whole affair
lasted for about an hour, when, glad to escape the heat and
noise, the officers returned to their ship.</p>

<p>Little further remains to be said of Delagoa Bay, though many
interesting facts might have been elicited in relation to the slave-trade,
had the Nemesis remained there longer. It appears very
evident that formerly the trade was carried on with greater
atrocity than at present, but enough is still known respecting it
to make us look upon the natives themselves as the worst
abettors of the traffic. The passions of the savage chiefs seem
only to be withheld for a moment, not suppressed, by the difficulty
of procuring slaves; and when they can neither find
enemies to seize, nor <i>culprits to condemn</i>, they sometimes send a
sort of marauding expedition to seize by treachery <i>their own
people</i>, and sell them into slavery. It is stated by Captain Owen,
that, within even a few years, under a former commandant, some
of the chiefs had been persuaded to sell their harmless subjects
for so trifling a sum as a dollar and a half each, or about seven
shillings, to be paid, not in money, but in merchandize of trifling
value, and that several cargoes had been obtained in this way for
the Brazilian market.</p>

<p>If we look for the most thriving mart for slaves upon the east
coast of Africa at the present time, we shall find it at the river
Quillimane, a little more than five hundred miles to the north of
Delagoa Bay. It lies about midway between that settlement and
Mozambique. There the slaves are purchased for coarse cloth,
gunpowder, beads, cutlery, &amp;c.; and the "arrival of one of the
little traders, with his pedler-kind of stock, among one of the
native tribes in the interior, becomes the signal for general warfare,
in which the weak become the victims of the strong." A few
years ago, no less than five thousand slaves were annually exported,
from this mart alone, to Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>It is indeed astonishing that a place so unhealthy in itself
as Quillimane should be able to keep up its constant supply of
human export. The soil and the very air are no less pestilential
than the traffic which debases it; but the effects of the demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
are felt far and wide, and, hundreds of miles in the interior, the
slave hunt, as it may be called, is carried on; and the ramifications
of this odious traffic spread themselves like the branches
of the upas-tree, not merely poisoning all within its shade, but becoming
more and more infectious as it branches out further from
the root.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>All preparations being at length completed, on the morning
of the 17th of August, just twenty days after having so providentially
succeeded in reaching her port of refuge, the Nemesis
was once more ready to continue her voyage.</p>

<p>On the 22nd August, she passed near the group of Rocky
Islands, called Bassa da India, which are situated nearly in the
middle of the channel, and pursued her voyage under sail. Of
course, her progress was slow against an adverse wind, and no
little anxiety was felt by her captain, on account of the uncertainty
of the compasses, and their discrepancy with each other.
She arrived, however, safely at Mozambique on the afternoon of
the 31st, without having had occasion to use her engines, except
just to carry her into the anchorage.</p>

<p>As she passed through the outer roads, she communicated
with H.M. brig Acorn, Captain Adams, which was on the look-out
for two slavers daily expected to arrive for cargoes; and, the
better to entrap them, she had hoisted a sort of decoy-flag at
her main, which she had already taken from one of the same
description. While a short visit was being paid on board, a
pilot had come off from the shore, to conduct the Nemesis into
the inner harbour, where she was soon brought to within a
quarter of a mile of the town. Little time, however, could be
spared for the visit, but there was still some necessary work to
be done on board, which could not be completed until the following
day.</p>

<p>As the errors of the compasses have been alluded to above,
and seem to have occasioned very great anxiety upon this passage,
it may be well to make some remarks about them again in
this place. It will be remembered, that before leaving Liverpool
a long series of experiments had been made, which were intended
to provide means of counteracting the local action of the iron of
the ship's hull upon the compasses. But no worse place can be
imagined than a crowded dock for the purpose of carrying on
experiments of such nicety. Disturbing causes were continually
operating, and the accident she met with on her way to Portsmouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
proved that the correctness of the compasses was very
far from being satisfactory. The experiments which were afterwards
made at Portsmouth were also very doubtful in their
result, in all probability owing, as before explained, to the
absence of the boxes of chain or broken iron, which are always
used by Professor Airy. It may readily be imagined that the
utmost anxiety was always felt on board the vessel on this
account, particularly when near the land; and many a long and
anxious night has been spent on deck, with frequently a leadsman
upon each of the paddle-boxes, to take soundings, and one
in the bowsprit besides.</p>

<p>The large magnets, as originally placed in their positions,
have never been moved, neither has the compass been changed
in the slightest degree. But although they have greatly <i>modified</i>
the errors, they have by no means sufficed to correct them. It
has been always found the safest course not to put faith in the
compasses at all; or rather, in this instance, observation showed
that a compass, suspended in a box from a cross spar, at the
height of ten or twelve feet above the head of the man at the
helm, acted with much more accuracy than any other, and it was
always the most relied on whenever it could be used.</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be doubted that the vessel has often made a
longer passage than she would have done had the compasses
been correct; for, in bad weather, when observations of the
celestial bodies could not be taken, she could scarcely have
avoided making many errors in her course. But nowhere were
these difficulties felt more anxiously than in this passage through
the Mozambique Channel, where land could never be very far
distant. The necessity for a constant good look-out, and for
two or even three men in the chains, produced anxiety and
fatigue in itself; while it was also necessary for the officers to
have the advantage of taking the altitudes of the stars, whenever
the night was clear enough, not only once, but many times
during the night. The compasses not only differed from the
true points, but differed also from each other; and particularly
in the Mozambique Channel, it was observed that they differed
more than elsewhere, without being influenced however by the
rapid atmospheric changes which prevailed. The more the
ship's course was directed towards the true pole, the less was the
error of the compass; but gradually, as her course was changed
towards the east or west, so did the errors and discrepancies of
the compasses increase.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to know that the same degree of difficulty
was not experienced on board the other iron steamers which
were sent out afterwards; and as the Nemesis was the first of
her class that ever made the voyage, it is right here to record
the difficulties she encountered under this head. Many an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
anxious watch has been spent on deck, trying to catch the altitude
of particular stars as they emerged, for a moment, from the
dense clouds or haze; and much of this kind of labour, so frequently
repeated, would have been saved had her compasses
been trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is now time to return to the anchorage at Mozambique,
where we left the Nemesis. Of course as she passed the principal
Portuguese fort, she fired a salute, which was returned, and
immediately became the signal to the whole town that something
uncommon was to be expected. The arrival of a large steamer
was soon made known in every direction, and not only became a
source of curiosity to all, but an object of great alarm to many.
The first impression was that she was sent purposely to put an
end to the slave-trade at that place, and the consternation became
general; for the governor, of whom more will presently be
said, at once encouraged this opinion, which he felt would
strengthen his power, as it did his determination, which was
proved to be perfectly sincere, to do his utmost to stop the trade.
Those most interested in the traffic had already begun openly to
defy his power, and had not hesitated to declare to him that they
would still carry it on in some of the shallow rivers, where
vessels of war could not approach them. But the sight of a
large steamer, running along close in shore, almost as if she
were a small boat, drawing at the same time only five feet and a
half of water, at once damped their ardour. They never could
have dreamed that a large heavily-armed vessel could move
wherever she pleased through their smallest streams; and their
alarm was proportioned to their surprise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>Shortly before this, there had been so strong a disposition to
resist the governor's power, that it had amounted almost to a
rebellion; and his Excellency, though a bold man, and the first
governor of the Portuguese possessions on that coast, who had
come with the honest determination to stop the trade at all
hazards, felt himself in a very awkward position. He, however,
felt himself strong enough to take extreme measures, the moment
he saw the steamer so close to the town. He afterwards admitted
that her arrival was most opportune, and so pleased was he, at
the same time, that he turned at once upon the slave-dealers;
even that very day he seized two large slavers, condemned them
at once, and publicly sold them by auction before the day was
over. Such vigorous measures had been quite unknown under
any former governor, and at once proved, both to the Portuguese
and to the world, that his professions were real, and that he
meant to keep his word. He had before this taken strong
measures against the dealers in slaves, but this bold step was the
finishing stroke of his policy, and at once filled all parties with
dismay. In fact, trade of all kinds was stagnant for the moment,
in consequence of the measures adopted; and large heaps of
valuable ivory were lying there useless, in consequence of the
impossibility, or, at all events, extreme hazard, of sending the
usual slave-ships to sea, which would convey it to a market.</p>

<p>The governor is a brigadier-general in the Portuguese service,
by name Joachim Pereira Morinho, and had formerly served
under the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula. He had not
been long on the coast; but, as he had come with a full determination
to destroy the slave-trade, or, at all events, to do his
utmost towards it, he had already been long enough there to gain
the ill-will of all the Portuguese residents. Indeed, he did not
live altogether in security from violence, arising from the vindictive
feelings of those interested in the traffic; and he had,
therefore, requested Captain Adams, in the Acorn, to remain
there as long as he could, to afford him protection; and had also
detained a small brig-of-war, belonging to his own country, named
the Villa Flora, to overawe the sea-faring part of the population.</p>

<p>The governor seemed to entertain the best feelings towards the
English generally, with whom he had associated a good deal,
and particularly inquired what assistance he could give to the
Nemesis. As fuel and vegetables were, of course, most in
request, they were mentioned. He appeared quite pleased to
have it in his power to furnish something that would be of use
to her; and, to the gratification of every one, a large boat came
off to the ship early in the morning, bringing a fat ox, four
sheep, a large pig, and some vegetables and fruit; besides which,
there was also a large country boat, full of wood, containing eight
thousand pieces. In addition to these very handsome presents,
he also proposed to fill up the ship's water free of expense.
This was accompanied by a note, in Portuguese, from the
secretary-general of the province, Don Antonio Julio di Castro
Pinto, of high degree and higher-sounding name, who was
charged by his Excellency to offer the good things above-mentioned,
"as a mark of his good-will, and of his sense of the
service which the visit of the Nemesis would render to the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of anti-slavery, and, at the same time, as a trifling present to a
brother in arms from an old soldier, grown grey in the service of
his country, both at home and abroad."</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more acceptable, and, through the
active assistance which the Nemesis received, she was enabled to
proceed on her voyage, after little more than a day's delay. As
an acknowledgment of his Excellency's attention, a trifling present
of some capital hollands, preserved salmon, and English pickles,
were sent to him, which were very great luxuries in that part of
the world, and appeared to be duly appreciated. His Excellency
had never before seen a steamer in those parts; and, the better
to acknowledge his good-nature, and increase the sensation her
arrival had produced on shore, he was invited by Captain Hall,
to come on board to look at the ship, and to partake of such refreshment
as she had to offer. This was, accordingly, a grand
day for all parties, and the 1st of September, 1840, will, on many
accounts, be long remembered at Mozambique.</p>

<p>His Excellency came on board in his state-barge, attended by
all his suite, in full uniform, under a salute from the batteries
and the Portuguese brig-of-war, while crowds of spectators stood
upon every point on shore, whence a good view could be obtained.
The deck of the Nemesis, though rather crowded with visitors,
presented a gay appearance, from the variety of uniforms and
foreign orders, which all those who were entitled to them, not
few in number, displayed upon the occasion.</p>

<p>Sufficient time having been spent in viewing the ship and inspecting
the machinery, which few of them had ever seen before,
the whole party sat down to a grand <i>déjeûner à la fourchette</i>.
Now, it may seem that a trifling incident of this sort could have
no possible connexion with the suppression of the slave-trade;
and, moreover, this latter question has been more frequently discussed
at tea-drinking parties among benevolent ladies, than at
champagne luncheons among the redoubtable sons of Mars.
Yet the impression which a thing makes is often of more consequence
than might otherwise be anticipated from the trifling
nature of the thing itself.</p>

<p>The healths of the Queens of England and of Portugal were
drank with three times three, followed immediately by a salute of
twenty-one guns, both from the steamer and the Portuguese
brig. The effect of this upon the inhabitants was by no means
unimportant; it impressed them more than ever with the conviction,
that the governments of the two countries were perfectly
united in their determination to suppress the slave-trade; and
the sound of the royal salutes ringing in their ears, completely
put an end, for the moment certainly, to all their inclinations to
resist the governor's authority.</p>

<p>In proof of his determination to do his utmost to suppress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
slave-trade, General Morinho had already ordered one of the
deputy-governors to be brought up to Mozambique, to be tried by
court-martial for disobedience of orders, in permitting the trade
under his own eyes; and, it has already been mentioned, that,
from the information which was given by the Nemesis, of the
slave-brig at Delagoa Bay, lying under the very guns of the fort,
the governor of that settlement was also to be sent for.</p>

<p>That no attention might be omitted, after the great kindness
his Excellency had shown to all on board, he and his party were
steamed some way up the river, to show them the capabilities of
the vessel; thousands of boats crowded round her in all directions,
while the house-tops, the fort, the beach, and all the ships in
port, were covered with people anxious to see the greatest novelty
the place had ever been witness to&mdash;the first steamer, moving
with rapidity about their fine harbour, and in whatever direction
she pleased.</p>

<p>A few words may not be out of place concerning the position
of Mozambique, and its eligibility as a place of call for fuel,
should steamers be sent more frequently by that route to India.
The following description of the harbour, taken from Captain
Owen's narrative of his surveys on that coast, will be found perfectly
correct. "It is formed by a deep inlet of the sea, five and
a half miles broad and six long, receiving the waters of three
inconsiderable rivers at its head. At the entrance are three small
islands, which, together with reefs and shoals, render the anchorage
perfectly safe in the worst weather. Of these islands, that of
Mozambique, on which stands the city, is completely formed of
coral, very low and narrow, and scarcely one mile and a half in
length. It is situated nearly in the centre of the inlet, and just
within the line of the two points that form its extremities. The
other two islands, called St. George and St. Jago, lie about three
miles outside of Mozambique, but close to each other. They
are uninhabited, although covered with rich verdure and trees,
but upon a coral foundation."</p>

<p>Mozambique was taken from the Arabs by the Portuguese, at
the very commencement of the sixteenth century; and the extent
of the fort of St. Sebastian, built there by them, and which,
even now, might be rendered a very strong fortification, capable
of mounting nearly a hundred guns, if in proper repair, will be
sufficient to show the great importance which they attributed to
it, even in that early period of its settlement. It still contains
large barracks and extensive quarters and storehouses, but only a
very small and feeble garrison, of scarcely more than a couple of
hundred men, either black or creole sepoys. There are likewise
two other smaller forts upon the island, which may therefore be
considered strongly fortified, although more indebted to the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
than to the present, for the importance, which, at first view, it
appears to possess.</p>

<p>The public buildings of Mozambique all bespeak the value of
the settlement to its possessors, in the days of Portuguese maritime
distinction. The governor's palace must have been, in its
best days, a residence worthy of an influential ruler. It is built
of stone, is of considerable extent, and has some fine rooms in
it; in fact, it speaks much for the importance attached by the
Portuguese, in former times, to their eastern possessions. The
large stone wharf, built on handsome arches, with the fine Custom
House, in a sort of square at the extremity of it, clearly point
out the ancient commercial value of the settlement; withered at
last, perhaps, more by the paralysing effects of the slave-trade,
than by any natural decrease in the commercial capabilities of the
east coast of Africa.</p>

<p>In short, the city has retrograded into comparative insignificance;
the number of resident Portuguese has become very inconsiderable,
with the exception of some Canareens or creole Portuguese, born
in other Portuguese possessions in India, and, though commonly
called white, only so "by courtesy," being often quite as black
as the true Indians. Bad government and moral deterioration
have added not a little to the other causes of its downfall; and
it will scarcely be credited, that a distinct law has been passed,
that those who were married should be compelled to remain there,
or, at least, not return to their own country. The effect of so
extraordinary a measure, has been, that nobody is disposed to get
married at all; and, so low a tone of moral feeling has come to
prevail, that the sexes live together openly, without any matrimonial
or moral ties, and with little feeling of shame at the
absence of them.</p>

<p>I have dwelt a little upon these particulars concerning Mozambique,
because it is the principal of all the Portuguese settlements
on that coast; and if, as such, it has fallen so far from its
former state, we may judge how the others must now be lingering
on between life and death. The fatal influence of the slave-trade
appears to paralyse the whole commercial traffic of the
country; the natives, being reduced to mutual distrust of each
other, and continually living in fear and poverty, are unable to
purchase the comforts of foreign manufactures. The selling of
slaves is almost the only profit of the chiefs, unfitting them for
every other enterprise, and deadening within them every feeling
of honour and every hope of improvement. A universal stagnation
seems to hang over the mind of man, as well as over the
productions of the earth. Were it not for the industry of the
Arab population in the neighbourhood, a periodical famine
would inevitably occur. At the present moment, the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the Portuguese possessions, along the Rios da Senna, do not
supply even enough grain for their own consumption. Yet
the country is a remarkably fine one, capable of producing
luxuriantly all the fruits of the earth, and, were it cleared and
cultivated, would become habitable even for Europeans, through
the improvement of its climate; yet, there is much land now
neglected and barren, which was once highly cultivated.</p>

<p>The slave-trade is, in fact, a worse pestilence to the country
than even the fever itself; and Mozambique, Quillimane, Delagoa
Bay, Sofala, and Inhamban, are all fallen to the lowest grade of
civilization. If you ask the simple tale of history, what has
been the effect of Portuguese rule upon that coast, you will hear
neither of savages reclaimed, soil improved, commerce extended,
justice and mercy practised, nor Christianity taught. The blight
of slavery has poisoned everything on which it rested.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as a place of call for refreshment, for ships
passing through the Channel, Mozambique has some claims
to attention. Abundance of vegetables and fruit are to be
obtained there; pigs and goats are readily to be purchased,
as well as poultry, and, were the demand for bullocks larger,
they would soon be brought to market in numbers. At present,
however, they are very dear.</p>

<p>But the great treasure of the place remains yet to be developed;
at all events, the subject is well open to investigation. The existence
of good coal in that neighbourhood is now, I believe for
the first time, made public. There is reason to expect that it
will be found in large quantity, and of good quality, although as
yet the search for it has not been carried on to any great extent.
The all-engrossing subject of the slave-trade seems to darken
every other object of attention in that quarter, and the Portuguese
are probably afraid that the discovery of coal in their
settlements would occasion the continual visits of so many
steamers and other vessels, that even greater difficulty would be
thrown in the way of the traffic.</p>

<p>Just as the Nemesis was leaving the harbour, the captain of
an English merchant ship, the only one there at the time,
brought off a large piece of excellent coal for inspection. It
had all the appearance of coal perfectly adapted for steaming
purposes; it was stated to be found at Quillimane, (the settlement
before alluded to) about three hundred miles to the southward
of Mozambique, and that there is every reason to believe it
might be procured in large quantities, and worked without
difficulty. This specimen was sent to England for examination,
by Captain Hall; but it has since been ascertained that it did
not reach its destination. This is on all accounts to be regretted.
It was sent down to the Cape of Good Hope from Mozambique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in a box, with directions that it should be forwarded to the India
House, but was probably lost, or set aside at the Cape.</p>

<p>If further investigation should prove what is here stated to be
correct, there can be no reason for not searching for coal upon
other parts of the coast; and under any circumstances, as
Quillimane is so short a distance from Mozambique, the coal
might easily be brought up to the latter at little expense; and,
if it were to become a more frequented route to India, it would
be desirable to moor a large coal-hulk off the town, in which a
constant supply of coal could be kept ready, and which could be
taken in rapidly, and at little expense, by a steamer running up
alongside of her.</p>

<p>But the Portuguese, unfortunately, seem quite blind, even to
their own interests; and they cannot perceive, that if they could
work coal-mines, they would employ a large population, circulate
wealth throughout their territory, and attract a considerable and
improving commerce to their port. But then their slave-trade
would be ruined: and they are not even wise enough in their
own generation to perceive, that out of its very ashes would
gradually spring up the healthy and vigorous plant of commerce,
upon an extensive scale, not only with foreign parts, but with
the native tribes of Africa. These, however, are now continually
desolated by the scourge of war and slavery. But they would
soon learn to value peace and peaceful arts, and the taste for
new articles of manufacture would grow gradually into wants,
and wants in course of time give birth to the wish for luxuries.
Far above all the profits of the traffic in human beings, would
then become the fruits of wholesome trade; the country would
advance, instead of being driven back; and the welfare of the
community and of the government be simultaneously promoted.</p>

<p>New regulations respecting trade would in the first instance be
indispensable, as at the present time the commandants or little
governors of all the minor Portuguese settlements are themselves
allowed to trade, and often are the principal, or in a manner the
only, merchants in the place. This alone must destroy all healthy
competition, the soul of commerce. But, were trade placed upon
a proper footing, and coal likely to become an article of demand,
it would easily be exported to the Cape, Mauritius, and up to
Aden for the Bombay steamers, and to numerous other parts, in
which the demand for coal is yearly increasing, and likely to
become almost unlimited.</p>

<p>I have here rather assumed that coal will be found in large
quantity than proved it; but sufficient has been said to point
out the great probability of its existence upon that coast in more
places than one, and the question involves such important consequences
that it deserves the fullest investigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at one time thought that coal would be found in some
one of the Comoro islands before alluded to, at the northern
extremity of the Mozambique Channel; and the Nemesis was
directed, at all events, to touch there on her way, for the purpose
of inquiring into its eligibility as a depôt, and place of refreshment
for steamers.</p>

<p>The distance of the nearest of the Comoro islands, Mohilla,
from Mozambique, is scarcely two hundred and fifty miles; and
from thence to Johanna, which is the principal one, and the
place of residence of the sultan or ruler of the islands, is about
thirty miles. Johanna lies as near as possible in the middle of
the Channel, between Madagascar and the mainland of Africa,
just where it widens into the open sea.</p>

<p>The Nemesis took her departure from Mozambique on the
evening of the 1st of September, but did not reach Johanna
until the afternoon of the 4th, having made nearly the whole
distance under sail only, against a very strong south-westerly
current.</p>

<p>The island of Mohilla is, of course, the first seen, and strikes
you by its lofty, wooded summit, and the numerous small islets
which surround it to the southward. The Channel between
Mohilla and Johanna is picturesque, and the high inland mountains
every where present a rich and refreshing appearance,
being covered with luxuriant wood, and broken occasionally
into deep glens, marked by the usual rich tropical verdure.
Johanna is the most frequented of all the islands, and affords
the best anchorage. But it was quite dark before the Nemesis
approached the bay, and an occasional blue light and a rocket
were let off, to give notice of her approach, in order that a pilot
might come off, or else a signal be made to direct her to the best
anchorage.</p>

<p>A large fire was soon lighted on shore for this purpose; and,
no sooner did she come within a moderate distance, than numerous
boats came alongside; the natives jumped on board, in
apparent delight at seeing her come in, not unmixed with
extreme surprise at her appearance, and the mode in which
she moved through the water. Several of them spoke broken
English, and although they were naturally delighted at the
prospect of earning a little money, they were even more so at
the sight of her armament, and at once concluded that she was
sent purposely to assist the sultan and the people of the island,
who were at that time in great danger and trouble.</p>

<p>Johanna is occasionally frequented by English ships, for provisions,
which are there abundant and reasonable, and the people
have become favourably known in England, in consequence of
their kind treatment of numerous poor English seamen, who
have from time to time been wrecked on those islands, or on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
neighbouring coasts. The great bay, which is on the northern
side of the island, is not, however, a very suitable anchorage,
except, perhaps, during the S.W. monsoon. At all times, there
is a very heavy surf rolling in shore; and, during the N.E.
monsoon, which sets directly into it, the heavy swell renders the
anchorage unsafe. It cannot, therefore, be considered at all
eligible as a coal depôt for steamers, particularly when Mozambique,
which has greater claims to attention, is within such a
moderate distance. Still, it is a very useful place of refuge for
our whaling ships in that part of the world; and, as the inhabitants,
as well as the authorities, have always shewn great kindness
to the English, and, in fact, consider themselves almost in
the light of allies of England, it would seem politic to keep alive
the good feeling they evince toward us.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these islands are principally of Moorish
origin, nearly all Mohammedans, and they wear the turban and
loose dress which belong to no part of the neighbouring coast;
and a dagger or pistols in their girdle are by no means uncommon.
They have a genuine old English or Arab mode of
shaking hands, with a gaiety of manner that is very pleasing.
Their features are regular, and well formed, and their complexion,
though dark, is very different from that of the inhabitants, either
of the neighbouring continent, or of the island of Madagascar.
In short, it is evident, that they were originally emigrants from
some distant part, probably Arab traders, although their appearance
has become modified in the course of successive generations.</p>

<p>These islanders appear to be rather favourites of the different
men-of-war and merchant ships which touch there; though they
have acquired a character for duplicity and cunning, and, consequently,
for telling falsehoods, which at the same time they
smooth over with the most artful flattery. But high testimony
has been often borne to their kindness and hospitality towards
Englishmen in distress; and, when the Exmouth grounded there
several years ago, with a great number of passengers, on her
way home, the Sultan Abdallah, the father of his present highness,
particularly distinguished himself, by even attending in
person to direct the efforts of his men, who came to assist in
getting the vessel off. He paid the utmost attention to all the
passengers, particularly to the women and children, taking care
that they should be provided with every thing he could furnish
for their comfort, until they could pursue their voyage further.
Nor is this by any means a solitary instance of the kind services
which they have rendered to our countrymen.</p>

been said about it in England before her departure for a tropical region. The timid,

learned smiled with more of curiosity than fear; but the officers of the vessel itself
were too busy about other matters to give themselves time to think much about the
question. During their voyage to the southward, when many dangers were encountered,
certainly that from lightning was amongst the least thought of; and now, as they
were passing through the Mozambique Channel, a part of the world particularly famous
for its heavy storms of thunder and lightning, not the slightest effect from it was observed
upon the iron vessel. The funnel has a perfectly smooth top, without any ornamental
points, such as are sometimes seen; and the main rigging and funnel stays were
made of chain at the top, and rope throughout the rest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>The present ruler, or sultan, of the Comoro Islands, by name
Alloué, is the son of the late sultan Abdallah, before alluded to
as having been particularly kind to distressed Englishmen. He
is a young man under thirty, of moderate height, agreeable countenance,
and easy, pleasant manners. But his character is not distinguished
for energy, and the difficulties with which he has had to
contend appear to have been rather beyond his powers. His father,
Abdallah, had made a treaty with Colonel Farquhar, when governor
of the Mauritius, by which he undertook to suppress, by every means
in his power, the extensive trade in slaves which was at that time
carried on at the islands which were under his dominion; and he
particularly distinguished himself by the zeal and perfect good
faith with which he carried out its provisions. Indeed, to this
cause, much of the subsequent difficulties of his family, and the
impoverishment of his people, seem to have been attributed.</p>

<p>In the latter days of Abdallah's life, he appears to have met
with sad reverses; and, judging from the documents which I
have been able to examine, it would seem that his determined
resistance to the continuance of the slave-trade raised up enemies
against him, not only in his own islands, but in the more powerful
one of Madagascar, and on the coast of Africa itself. It is
certain, also, that he was at all times favourably regarded by the
government of Bombay, for his services to the Company's ships,
and, as an acknowledgment of his assistance, a present was sent
to him every three years, of a small supply of arms and ammunition.
Abdallah's death was, however, at length brought about,
after suffering numerous hardships, by the treacherous and cruel
treatment of an emissary from Madagascar, or one of the more
than half-savage chiefs of that island, into whose hands he at
length fell.</p>

<p>This is not the place to enter at large into the subject of
Madagascar history; it will be sufficient to remark that the present
queen of that country is a most cruel and tyrannical sovereign;
that she sets little value upon the lives or blood of her subjects,
and that she is supposed to have poisoned her predecessor, the
late King Radaman; further, that she did not succeed in winning
the throne without sacrificing most of the chiefs who were opposed
to her, and that she has since contrived to bring under her
subjection many who were formerly independent governors, or
chiefs, of the territory they severally occupied. Those who take
an interest in missionary enterprises will also have heard of the
dreadful cruelties she has exercised upon those unhappy men
within her territories, most of whom were barbarously put to
death, some in her presence, and partly, it is said, by her own
hand. Only one or two of them escaped from the island.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural, under these circumstances, that one or
more of the chiefs of the island should have taken refuge in the
neighbouring islands of Johanna and Mohilla. Accordingly, so
long ago as 1828, a chief, called Raymanytek, who had been
governor of an important province in Madagascar under the old
king, and was said by some to be his brother, came over to
Johanna with about one hundred followers, and represented to
Sultan Abdallah, that he had made his escape from his own
country, through fear of the queen, who sought his life, (probably
he had tried to get possession of the chief authority himself,) and
that, as he understood the inhabitants of the Comoro Islands
were allies of the English, <i>as well as himself</i>, he came there to
beg for an asylum. There was something very suspicious in his
story; but, nevertheless, Abdallah received him in a very friendly
manner, placing a house and lands at his disposal, and shewing
him other civilities.</p>

<p>Probably, however, entertaining some mistrust of his new
visitor, Abdallah sent an envoy to Bombay to make known the
particulars of his arrival, and to ask whether the government
would feel satisfied with his residence upon the islands under his
dominion. He suspected, no doubt, that the new chief might
soon become a troublesome visitor, and was anxious to endeavour
to secure some further assistance from Bombay, should he stand
in need of it. It is likely, also, that he wished to obtain some
information respecting the character of Raymanytek.</p>

<p>From Bombay, reference was made to the government of the
Mauritius upon the subject, as being better acquainted with the
political state of Madagascar. In the meantime, the chief, not
content with a residence in the neighbourhood of Sultan Abdallah,
went to the opposite or southern side of the island, where he
purchased a small native vessel, for the evident purpose of
trading in slaves. The little craft made several voyages across
to the coast of Africa; and, at length, Abdallah remonstrated
with him upon the subject, and informed him that if this clandestine
trade were not discontinued, he should make him leave
the island altogether. To this no reply was made; and still the
vessel went across to the coast, bringing back, on one occasion,
nearly two hundred slaves. Many of these were probably re-exported
to other parts.</p>

<p>Abdallah hereupon ordered his disobedient visitor immediately
to quit the island, upon the ground that the slave-trade could
not be permitted within his territory, the more particularly as he
was bound by treaty with the English to prevent it in every way
he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>To this summons Raymanytek made no other reply than to
bring all his followers together armed, and, by means of bribery
and fair promises, to enlist in his cause some of the poorer inhabitants
in his neighbourhood, and also to arm as many of his
negro slaves as he could prevail upon, and who appeared trustworthy.
Money seemed at all times to be at his command, and
he is said to have brought a well-filled purse with him when he
landed from Madagascar. With the force he had now collected,
he made an unexpected descent upon the capital of the island,
which, being unprepared, was, of course, unable to resist him.
The consternation was general, in addition to which, his money
is believed to have influenced some of the people to remain
quiet.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the old Sultan Abdallah was deposed, and
his brother Ali took the chief power into his hands. Abdallah,
with all the rest of his family, left the island, with the hope of
being able to find an opportunity of reaching some English port,
where he might represent his case, and ask for assistance. He
reached the island of Comoro in safety; but what became of him
afterwards, until he was ultimately put to death with extreme
barbarity, as before stated, I have hitherto not been able to
ascertain.</p>

<p>During this short interval, Raymanytek had been able to get
possession of the arms belonging to Abdallah, and which I have
stated were supplied every two or three years by the government
of Bombay, as a recompence for his friendly assistance when
needed; and, having burnt and ruined the greater part of the
town, and completely destroyed the crops and plantations in the
neighbourhood, he embarked on board his little vessel, and,
taking with him all that he could conveniently carry away of any
value, he withdrew to the island of Mohilla, and established himself
there in a position easy of defence; all the subsequent
efforts of the rightful authorities to turn him out were of no
avail.</p>

<p>This man must have been supplied, by some means or other,
with abundance of ammunition; and it is not unlikely that his
speculations in the slave-trade, by means of his own vessel, may
have supplied him not only with money, but also with warlike
weapons and ammunition. It is well surmised, too, that he
received assistance direct from Madagascar at various times; and
it must not be forgotten that the nine or ten years which elapsed
between the commencement of these occurrences and the visit of
the Nemesis was a period particularly fraught with difficulties in
relation to the traffic in slaves, and that it appears <i>primâ facie</i>,
highly probable that this marauding rebel may have been strongly
encouraged, and even aided, in his attempts, by distant parties
interested in the traffic. Indeed, unless some assistance of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
kind had been furnished to him, it is difficult to see how he could
so long have found means to maintain himself.</p>

<p>The sultan applied for assistance on several occasions to the
government of the Mauritius, of the Cape, and of Bombay. The
letter of the young sultan Alloué, after the death of his father,
in 1836, addressed to the governor of the Cape of Good Hope,
and to the admiral of the station, asking for assistance, was a
really pathetic appeal to their good feelings. It detailed the
horrors of poor old Abdallah's death, and the violent acts of the
invader; it related the defenceless state in which he found himself
on taking the reins into his hands; and then appealed to
British generosity, in return for the faithful adhesion of his
family to Great Britain, and the hospitality of his people towards
all British subjects.</p>

<p>The answer on that occasion was prompt, and worthy of the
cause&mdash;namely, "that in consequence of the difficulties in which
the sultan of Johanna was placed, and in consideration of the
fidelity with which the late Sultan Abdallah had fulfilled his
engagements for the suppression of the slave-trade, and the
hospitality which he had on all occasions shewn to British
vessels touching at Johanna, the governor and admiral readily
yield to the earnest desire of the Sultan Alloué for the aid of
arms and ammunition, and send an ample supply thereof to
Johanna in one of his majesty's sloops of war," &amp;c.</p>

<p>With this assistance, Alloué was once more able to make head
for the time against his enemy. But the country still continued
in a very unsettled state; and, as the assistance was only temporary,
he again fell into extreme difficulty, and addressed himself
to the governor of the Mauritius upon the subject. Sir
William Nicolai, who was governor and commander-in-chief of
that island at that time, referred the application to the consideration
of the home government. But it would seem that
some little intrigues had sprung up among the sultan's own
family, which it is not very easy, and so far very unimportant, to
fathom.</p>

<p>The Sultan Alloué's uncle, Seyd Abbas, had about the same
time sent two young men, either his sons or nephews, to the
Mauritius, to report the unhappy state of the island, and to
request assistance in support of the actual Sultan Alloué. Not
long afterwards two or three other young men arrived at the
Mauritius, also bearing letters from Seyd Abbas to the same
purport. As this man was thought to be well disposed towards
the English, and had been favourably spoken of by all those
who had visited the island, and as, moreover, his object seemed
to be the laudable one of trying to support the young sultan's
authority, even though without his highness's acknowledged
sanction, it was judged proper to maintain all these young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
men at the public expense, until an opportunity should offer for
sending them back again. After the lapse of some months, a
vessel was hired on purpose to carry them back; and it was at
the same time distinctly intimated that, "however praiseworthy
the intentions of Seyd Abbas may have been in sending his own
relations from home as political messengers, and however high
he may stand personally in the respect of Englishmen, it would
in future be impossible for British authorities to maintain political
correspondence with him or with any other person in Johanna
than his highness the sultan of the island." The sultan was
further recommended henceforth to give Seyd Abbas a share of
his confidence in his councils, in consequence of his age and
experience, and the apparent sincerity with which he espoused
his interest; and, at the same time, the young men were recommended
to his notice as very sensible and well-informed persons.
The friendly interest and intentions of the government towards the
sultan and people of Johanna were then in general terms expressed;
and thus, with kind words and kinder hopes for better
days for his subjects, the young sultan was left for the present to
take care of himself.</p>

<p>It was only a few months before the arrival of the Nemesis
that some of the events which have been recorded had occurred.
The Sultan Alloué was still in extreme danger; and another
letter was addressed by him to the governor of the Mauritius,
only about five months previously. It appears to have been remarkably
well written, and contains some ingenious observations
which, as being written by a young Moorish prince, the ruler of
an island in a remote corner of the globe, under circumstances
of great difficulty, it may be worth while to dwell upon it for a
moment.</p>

<p>He thanks his excellency the governor of the Mauritius for
the kindness he had shewn to the young men, whom he admits
to be distantly related to him; but shrewdly remarks that their
"clandestine departure from Johanna, contrary to his express
orders, and during the night, had given him reason to suppose
that they were not quite so friendly disposed towards him as they
wished his excellency to believe: and that he feared the object of
their journey had been a pecuniary speculation upon the governor's
goodness and British hospitality." He proceeds to express
his thanks for being apprised that persons had entertained political
correspondence with English authorities without his knowledge
or consent; and adds, that, although he fully concurs in
his excellency's opinion with regard to the age and experience of
his uncle, Seyd Abbas, still there are many others in Johanna who
possess the same qualities, and whose attachment and loyalty he
had <i>never had occasion to doubt</i>.</p>

<p>The suspicion here betrayed is self-evident, and sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
delicately expressed. The picture he then draws of the state of
his country is a pitiable one for a prince himself to be obliged to
depict&mdash;"The town burnt; the country ravaged; all our cattle
killed by the chief, Raymanytek, aided by natives of Mohilla,
under his orders." He distinctly intimates that the rebel chief
was receiving "assistance from the French;" and, although he
does not state reasonable grounds for the assertion, the statement
is not altogether an improbable one, considering that the abolition
of slavery in the Mauritius had roused the feeling of the
French population against us and our allies: and, moreover,
slavery was still in existence in the neighbouring island of
Bourbon, where strong feelings against the English had been
undisguisedly avowed; while, at the same time, the difficulty of
procuring fresh slaves had greatly raised their price.</p>

<p>Intrigues were thought to have been carried on by the
French traders in Madagascar itself, where they have long
attempted to obtain a footing, but with little success, owing to
the deadly nature of the climate. It is, however, perfectly well-known
that they are still anxious to strain every nerve to establish
themselves in some place eastward of the Cape, in addition
to the island of Bourbon, where there is no harbour whatever,
but merely an open roadstead. They are, moreover, anxious to
get some <i>point d'appui</i> whence they may injure British trade, in
case of war, in that quarter; and, at the same time, by establishing
a little colony of their own, find some means of augmenting
their mercantile marine.</p>

<p>One of their latest attempts has been at the Isle Madame; and
it is perfectly well known that several other efforts have been
made, and still more talked about.</p>

<p>If, however, Raymanytek really did receive any foreign assistance,
it is not probable that it was with the knowledge or connivance
of the government of Bourbon, but rather from the
restless enterprise of private individuals interested in the slave
trade. However that may be, there seems to be very good
grounds for our hoping that the Sultan Alloué may be permitted
to remain in the peaceable possession of his own rightful territories.
It is our evident interest to prevent those fine islands
from falling into any other hands, more especially now that the
intercourse between the West and East, through the Mozambique
channel, is likely to be more extensive than formerly; and that
the opening for legitimate commerce, within the channel itself,
cannot but attract the attention of British merchants. The trade
in slaves will become yearly more difficult, and, indeed, nothing
would tend more to cause its total downfall than the gradual extension,
under proper government protection, of the legitimate
trade in British manufactures along that coast.</p>

<p>The young Sultan Alloué further went on to declare in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
letter that numbers of his people had been captured and taken
to Mozambique and Zanzibar, where they <i>were sold into slavery</i>;
and that several such cargoes had already been sent over. He
begged earnestly that assistance might speedily be sent to him,
in arms and ammunition, and that he particularly stood in need
of lead and flints, and a couple of small field-pieces. At the
same time, he entreated that some small vessel of war might
be sent to his aid; for that such were his difficulties, that,
unless speedy assistance should arrive, he feared that he should
be driven to abandon the town, and seek personally an asylum in
British India. He then appealed to the magnanimity of the
British government, in the hope that he and his people might
not be compelled to abandon their homes for want of timely
assistance.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, was the unhappy situation of the beautiful little
island of Johanna, as described by its own prince, only a few
months before the unexpected visit of the Nemesis. Little
change had taken place; the town still held out, but it does not
appear that any assistance had been sent to it. The very sight
of the steamer gladdened the young sultan's heart, and encouraged
the people, who stood greatly in need of it; the rebel chief
being then at only a short distance from the town.</p>

<p>Late as it was, the captain and Lieut. Pedder landed in uniform
to wait upon the sultan at once, as their time was so limited.
One of his uncles and his prime minister received them, and
accompanied them through a few narrow streets, built in the
Moorish style, to the sultan's palace. At the entrance were
stationed four half-clad soldiers, with muskets, as a personal
guard; and, on reaching the reception room, the sultan was
discovered sitting on a high-backed chair, at the further end of
the apartment. He immediately rose and advanced towards
them in a very friendly manner, welcoming them to Johanna
with a good, hearty shake by the hand. Two chairs were placed
on his left, for his guests, while, on his right, sat the governor
of the town, and several other of the principal people, all on the
tip-toe of expectation for the news from England, the more particularly
as they were in some hope that the strange-looking "<i>devil-ship</i>,"
as they called her, might have brought a letter from the
English government, in answer to his application for assistance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>They were doomed, however, to be again disappointed; but
the sultan made many inquiries about the Queen and Prince
Albert, and whether an heir to the throne had yet been born,
and seemed not a little curious to know if the Thames Tunnel
was finished. In short, he appeared to be a very well-bred and
courteous young man. He alluded painfully to the distressed
state of the island, and to his being surrounded by his enemies
under Raymanytek, and begged hard for at least a little powder
and shot, with which to endeavour to hold out until better
assistance could reach him.</p>

<p>As it was already quite late, the interview did not last long,
but promises were made to renew it on the subsequent day, and
a party was arranged for an excursion outside the town on the
following morning. Accordingly, at daylight, the party were
again met by the king's uncle on the beach, who appointed three
soldiers to act both as guides and guards. These men appeared
quite pleased with the duty assigned to them, and throughout the
whole trip did everything in their power to amuse the party, and
to point out to them the objects best worth notice; one man
went in search of shells upon the beach, another to procure
fruit, and scarcely a wish was expressed that was not immediately
gratified.</p>

<p>Having ascended the hills on the eastern side of the valley,
they were gratified by a delightful prospect in every direction.
The valley below was rich and capable of high cultivation, but
only partially cleared of wood, and in other parts covered with
long grass and low shrubs, varied by the numerous wild flowers
which were then in blossom. In the rear were high and thickly-wooded
mountains, picturesque in themselves, but shutting out
the view of the opposite side of the island, while, in the other
direction, the eye could trace the long line of picturesque coast,
giving altogether a very favourable impression of the character
of the island, the more particular as some of the timber is very
fine, and calculated for repairing ships.</p>

<p>The town itself could only be viewed from the top of a higher
hill behind it, which was now ascended, and its character well
made out. Its little white flat-topped houses and turreted walls,
with very narrow streets, pointed out its Moorish origin. But
there was nothing to render it otherwise striking.</p>

<p>The whole population appeared to be abroad, each struggling
which should gratify his curiosity the quickest, in running down
to the beach to catch a glimpse of the strange vessel, the like of
which none had ever seen before. Boats were seen crowding
round her on all sides, and, as she lay there, decked out with all
her flags, the scene was both animated and picturesque.</p>

<p>On descending the hill, the party were again met by the
sultan's uncle, who invited them to breakfast with his highness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and accompanied them, first to his own house, where they met
the sultan himself, and thence to the palace, which was close at
hand. But it was still rather an early hour for a reception, and
on entering the palace, it was very evident that the preparations
had not yet been completed for their arrival. His highness's
ladies, the sultana and her companions, had only just time to
make their escape, leaving everything in disorder, and, in short,
breakfast was not quite ready.</p>

<p>His highness was very condescending, but it was clear that his
attentions were being divided between two or more objects at the
same time, one of which was readily guessed to be the ladies
fair, who had so suddenly decamped. But this was not the only
one, and, in the little intervals between his exits and his entrances,
an opportunity was taken to ask his uncle, who was present, what
it was all about. The mystery was solved. His highness was
condescending to superintend the preparation of the breakfast
for his guests, that it might be worthy of them. The kitchen
was on this occasion converted into the council-chamber, and
quite as weighty matters there discussed, and certainly with equal
warmth, and probably, too, with the full "ore rotundo" of hungry
eloquence, as are often treated of with greater solemnity in higher
conclaves.</p>

<p>The result, indeed, was worthy of the cause. The breakfast
was pronounced capital, and ample justice done, after the morning's
walk, to the wisdom of his highness's deliberations. He
himself seemed quite delighted, and his uncle declared to Captain
Hall, in his absence, that the young man's greatest pleasure was
to contrive some new means of gratifying the English who came
in his way, and that there was nothing he would not condescend
to do for them, in his enthusiastic admiration of the nation. A
little of this might be said and done for effect, but there has
always been good reason to believe that he was on all occasions
a sincere, and, in some respects, useful ally.</p>

<p>The same day, a grand entertainment was to be given by some
relation of the Sultan's, in his uncle's house, in honour of the
performance of the first Mohammedan rite upon the young
infant, his son and heir, upon the eighth day after its birth. The
sultan himself, with his chief minister, accompanied them to see
the festivities. On this occasion, the ladies of the court were all
found to be in the apartment adjoining the reception room, and
only separated from it by a large screen or curtain before the
door. Now, according to all the prescribed rules of civilized
life, it may reasonably be supposed that the fair damsels, secluded
as they usually were, had just as much curiosity to see
the lions of the day, the English officers in uniform, as the latter
had to catch a glimpse of eastern beauty, the more sought the
more forbidden. Every now and then you could see the curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
moved gently on one side, and a young lady's head peep out;
and then another would steal a quiet look on the other side;
then again, by pressing against each other, more of them would
be seen than they intended, but quite enough to make you wish
to see more still. In the meantime his highness had retired, or
perhaps they might not have been so bold.</p>

<p>As the gallantry of the sons of Neptune has at all times been
famous, so in this instance it innocently got the better of their
discretion, and, with an apparently accidental, though well-premeditated
charge at the curtain, which was most gallantly pushed
on one side, a full view of all the fair ladies was obtained, much more
to the apparent horror of the old uncle, who was a spectator of
the achievement, than to that of the fair damsels themselves,
who, nevertheless, quietly retreated in some trepidation. The
ladies were all very handsomely and gaudily dressed, it being a
gala-day, but they were not altogether the most Venus-like of
beauties.</p>

<p>But a more curious scene was brought to view on being conducted
to another apartment, where a large and merry party of
ladies of less distinguished rank were amusing themselves with
dancing and singing, but certainly without much grace in the
one or melody in the other. There was only one good-looking
female among the whole assembly, and she appeared to be the
queen of beauty, or mistress of the feast, for she was treated with
the utmost attention and deference by all the rest.</p>

<p>On returning again to the presence of the sultan, refreshments
were handed round, and, as the weather was hot, a whole train
of the female servants of the house were ushered into the room,
each with a fan, or sort of portable punka, in her hand. They
were all very neatly and cleanly dressed, and immediately set
their fans most dexterously to work, taking their stations behind
each person of the party.</p>

<p>In the midst of this scene the sultan disappeared, followed by
his uncle, and, after a few minutes' consultation, the attendance
of Captain Hall was requested in his highness's private apartment.
Something important was evidently about to happen, but,
before there was much time to conjecture what it might be, he
found himself alone with the sultan. His highness frankly confessed
the alarm which the strength of the chief named Raymanytek
had excited in his mind, that he was even then not far
from the town, and that he himself was determined at once to
march out against the rebels, if he could get a sufficient supply
of powder and shot. At the same time he begged that, if necessary,
he might have the assistance of the steamer to protect his
town.</p>

<p>Only one reply could be given, namely, that the visit of the
steamer was a mere casual thing, with a view to ascertain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
nature of the harbour; that the service she was engaged on
would admit of no delay, but that, as long as she was there,
which could not be many hours more, she should give protection
to himself and his family, as well as to the town, if in danger,
and that a small supply of ammunition should be given to him
to enable him to defend himself. He appeared quite satisfied,
and pleased with the reply. At the same time, as the danger
was imminent, and much blood might otherwise be shed, he requested
that, since the orders by which the steamer was obliged
to abide would necessitate her immediate departure, the British
flag might be hoisted upon his citadel before she started, and
receive the proper salute, in order to intimidate the rebel chief;
and further, that a letter might be written to the latter, stating
that the sultan of Johanna was an old ally of Great Britain, and
that the taking up arms against him could no longer be permitted;
in short, that he had, therefore, better take himself off
as quickly as possible, and return to obedience.</p>

<p>This was a request which demanded very serious consideration.
It was evident that Captain Hall had no authority whatever to
interfere in the matter. And such, consequently would have
been the only reply of many officers, perhaps most, under the
same circumstances. But, there was now something of humanity
called into play, something of pity, and something, perhaps, of
pride. It was impossible not to feel a deep interest in the unhappy
position of the young sultan, more particularly as he and
all his family had on so many occasions behaved with kindness
and humanity towards Englishmen in distress. He had, moreover,
stated his positive wish to become not only the ally, but
even the subject of Great Britain, and that he would rather give
up the island altogether to the English, and, if necessary, retire
from it elsewhere, than see it in its then state of misery from the
incursions of Raymanytek.</p>

<p>There was, in fact, something in Alloué's appeal, which was
altogether irresistible; and after much reflection, and well knowing
the responsibility incurred, it was agreed that the British
flag should be hoisted upon the citadel, under a salute of twenty-one
guns. This was accordingly done, and for the first time, the
flag, which so many millions look upon with pride, waved over
the citadel and walls of Johanna. The sultan smiled, and appeared
to take far greater pride in that unstained ensign, than in
his own independent flag, or his own precarious authority.</p>

<p>Great were the rejoicings of the whole people of the town; in
fact, the day had been one of continued excitement to all parties.
To crown the whole, a letter was written to the rebel chief,
according to the tenour of what has been stated above, and which,
it was hoped, would induce Raymanytek to retire peaceably for
the present, and to defer to an opportunity less favourable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
himself, if not altogether to forego, his treasonable designs,
which had evidently been to depose the sultan, and probably put
him to death, and banish all his family, assuming the whole
authority himself in his place.</p>

<p>This had been a long and eventful day for the Nemesis, and
while we have been relating what was passing on shore, those on
board had been busy taking in water and wood for the immediate
continuance of the voyage. One thing, however, yet remained;
the sultan was to visit the ship, and see what to him
were wonders. He came on board in the afternoon, with several
attendants, in full Moorish dress, and, of course, evinced the
utmost astonishment at the arrangement of the ship, the machinery,
&amp;c. To him and his followers all was new. As they
steamed round the bay, their wonderment increased more and
more at the ease and rapidity with which she moved; and having
partaken of a little fruit and bread, and taken a most friendly
and, to all appearance, grateful leave of Captain Hall, and all on
board, he was landed in the ship's boat, with his own flag flying
upon it.</p>

<p>On landing, he seemed quite overwhelmed with thankfulness
for the timely assistance rendered to him, and unaffectedly sorry
at parting with friends, he had so recently made.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 5th September, 1840, the interesting
little island of Johanna was left behind, with many good wishes
for the success of the sultan's arms, and for the speedy restoration
of peace and plenty to his harassed subjects. It is feared, however,
that these hopes have scarcely yet been realized.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The sultan very recently went up to Calcutta, to apply to the Governor-general, in
the hope that the Company might be induced to take possession of the islands, which
he felt he could no longer hold without assistance. He merely asked for himself a
small annual stipend out of the revenues. What answer he may have received is not
known; but probably his application was rejected, upon the ground of our territory in
the East being already quite large enough. But, in reality, the Comoro Islands, or at
least a part of them, must be viewed in a political light, as they may be said to command
the <i>navigation</i> of the straits, and are generally thought to be an object aimed at by the
French.</p></div>

<p>
"The French have, within the last month, obtained, by fraud, possession of the
islands of Johanna, Mohilla, and Peonaro; they had already, by the same means, obtained
the islands of Mayotte and Nos Beh. There are at present out here eleven ships
of war&mdash;the largest a 60-gun frigate; more are expected out, in preparation for the
conquest of all Madagascar; and also, it is said, of the coast of Africa, from latitude
10 S. to 2 S.; this portion includes the dominions of the Imaum of Muscat. At this
place (Nos Beh) a system of slavery is carried on that you are not aware of. Persons
residing here, send over to places on the mainland of Africa, as Mozambique, Angoza,
&amp;c., money for the purchase of the slaves; they are bought there for about ten dollars
each, and are sold here again for fifteen dollars; here again they are resold to French
merchant vessels from Bourbon and St. Mary's for about twenty-five to thirty dollars
each. Captains of vessels purchasing these use the precaution of making two or three
of the youngest free, and then have them apprenticed to them for a certain term of
years, (those on shore,) fourteen and twenty one years. These papers of freedom will
answer for many. It is a known fact, that numbers have been taken to Bourbon, and
sold for two hundred and three hundred dollars each. Those who have had their freedom
granted at this place, (Nos Beh,) as well as others, are chiefly of the Macaw tribe.
The Indian, of Havre, a French bark, took several from this place on the 20th of September
last; she was bound for the west coast of Madagascar, St. Mary's, and Bourbon.
L'Hesione, a 32-gun frigate, has just arrived from Johanna, having compelled one of
the chiefs to sign a paper, giving the island up to the French. On their first application,
the king and chiefs of Johanna said, that the island belonged to the English. The
French then said, that if it was not given up, they would destroy the place; they, after
this, obtained the signature of one of the chiefs to a paper giving up the island to the
French.

The account given in the above letter is partly borne out by the following announcement,
which appeared in the <i>Moniteur</i>, the French official newspaper, in March, 1844;
the substance of it is here copied from <i>The Times</i> of the 14th March, and there can be
little doubt concerning the object of the French in taking the active step alluded to. We
must hope, therefore, that our interests in that quarter will be properly watched, particularly
when we remember what serious injury would be inflicted upon the whole of our
Eastern trade, in case of war, by the establishment of the French in good harbours to
the eastward of the Cape. The announcement is as follows:&mdash;"Captain Des Fossés
has been appointed Commander of the station at <span class="smcap">Madagascar</span>, and Bourbon, which was
hitherto placed under the orders of the Governor of Bourbon. This station now
acquires a greater degree of importance. Captain Des Fossés having under his orders
<i>five</i> or <i>six</i> ships of war, will exhibit our flag along the <i>whole coast of Africa</i>, and in
the Arabian Seas. He will endeavour to extend our <i>relations with Abyssinia</i>, and our
<i>influence in Madagascar</i>."</p>

<p>The next place towards which the Nemesis was destined to
shape her course was the island of Ceylon, where at length was
to be made known to her the ultimate service upon which she
was to be employed. It was not until the 10th that she lost
sight of Comoro island, the northernmost of the group of that
name, and, if measured in a direct line, considerably less than
one hundred miles from Johanna.</p>

<p>Horsburgh particularly notices the light, baffling winds, and the
strong, south-west and southerly currents, which prevail during
the months of October and November among the Comoro Islands.
But it was found upon this voyage that these difficulties presented
themselves sometimes much earlier than stated by him.
It was now only the beginning of September, and the southerly
current was found setting down at the rate of even sixty miles a
day. Indeed, both the winds and currents in the Mozambique
Channel had been found very different from what had been expected.
It was the season of the south-west monsoon when she
entered it in the month of August; and as it is usually stated
that this wind continues to blow until early in November, the
Nemesis ought to have had favourable winds to carry her quite
through, even later in the season. On the contrary, she met
with a strong head-wind, and a much stronger southerly current
than she had reason to expect.</p>

<p>The opinion of Horsburgh seems to be fully confirmed, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
late in the season it is better for ships to avoid the Mozambique
Channel, and rather to proceed to the eastward of Madagascar,
and then pass between Diego Garcia and the Seychelle Islands.
Steamers, however, would have less need of this were coal to be
had at Mozambique.</p>

<p>From the equator, the current was always easterly; but nothing
particular occurred worth noticing, except that, as she approached
the Maldive Islands, she encountered very heavy
squalls, accompanied with rain.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 1st October, the Maldives were in
sight; and, in order to carry her through them rapidly, steam
was got up for a few hours, until she came to, in the afternoon,
within a quarter of a mile of the shore, under one of the easternmost
of the islands, named Feawar, having shaped her course
straight across the middle of the long, and until lately, much
dreaded group of the Maldive Archipelago.</p>

<p>This extensive chain or archipelago of islands lies in the very
centre of the Indian Ocean, and, being placed in the direct
track of ships coming from the south-west towards Ceylon, and
the southern parts of Hindostan, it was long dreaded by mariners,
and shunned by them as an almost impenetrable and certainly
dangerous barrier. It is stated by Horsburgh, that the early
traders from Europe to India were much better acquainted with
these islands than modern navigators, and that they were often
passed through in these days without any apprehension of danger.
The knowledge of their navigable channels must therefore
have been, in a great measure, lost; and, although the utmost
credit is due to the indefatigable Horsburgh for his arduous
efforts to restore some of the lost information, it is to the liberality
of the Indian government, and particularly to the scientific
labours and distinguished services of Captain Moresby and Commander
Powell, of the Indian navy, that we are indebted for the
minute and beautiful surveys of all these intricate channels which
have been given to the world since 1835.</p>

<p>This archipelago is divided into numerous groups of islands,
called by the natives Atolls, each comprising a considerable
number of islands, some of which are inhabited, and abound in
cocoa-nut trees, while the smaller ones are often mere barren
rocks or sandy islets. The number of these islands, large and
small, amounts to several hundred; and the groups, or Atolls,
into which they are divided, are numerous. They are laid down
with wonderful accuracy and minuteness by Captains Moresby
and Powell; so that, with the aid of their charts, the intricate
channels between them can be read with almost the same facility
as the type of a book. Thus one of the greatest boons has been
conferred upon navigators of all nations. They are disposed in
nearly a meridian line from latitude 7° 6' N. to latitude 0° 47' S.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and consequently extend over the hottest portion of the tropics,
for the distance of more than three hundred and seventy miles.</p>

<p>As the Nemesis passed through these islands, she found that
all the former difficulties had now vanished. So accurate were
the soundings, and given on so large a scale, that it was more
like reading a European road-book than guiding a vessel through
an intricate labyrinth of islands.</p>

<p>The very sight of a steamer completely frightened the inhabitants
of the little island of Feawar; who, although they at length
came alongside without much fear, could never be persuaded
to come on board the vessel. However, they had no objection
to act as guides, for the purpose of shewing what was to be seen
upon their island; and, while a little necessary work was being
done to the vessel, Captain Hall and two or three of the officers
landed, and were soon surrounded by a crowd of natives upon
the beach, quite unarmed.</p>

<p>A stroll along the shore, covered with pieces of coral, soon
brought them to a mosque and burial-ground, which was remarkable
for the neatness with which it was disposed. The little
ornamented head-stones, with inscriptions, and flowers in many
places planted round them, probably refreshed by the sacred
water of a well close at hand, proved, at all events, the great
respect paid to their dead, which is common among all Mohammedans.
Indeed, the inhabitants of all these numerous islands
are mostly of that persuasion, and consider themselves to be
under the protection of England, the common wish of almost all
the little independent tribes of the East.</p>

<p>The village itself appeared to be at least half deserted, the
poor people, particularly the women, having hastily run away,
leaving their spinning-wheels at their doors. They appear to
carry their produce, consisting of oil, fish, rope, mats, &amp;c., to
Ceylon and other parts of India, in large boats of their own construction,
bringing back in return rice and English manufactured
goods. Indeed, an extensive traffic is carried on between all
the northernmost of this extensive chain of islands, or submarine
mountains, and the nearer parts of the coast of India.</p>

<p>On the same evening, the Nemesis continued her voyage, and,
on the afternoon of the 5th October, reached the harbour of Pointe
de Galle, in Ceylon. She came in under steam, with about
eight tons of coal remaining, having been exactly one month
from Johanna.</p>

<p>The mystery attending the Nemesis was now to end. Scarcely
had she fairly reached her moorings, when a despatch was delivered
to the captain from the government of India, containing
orders from the Governor-general in council, to complete the
necessary repairs, and take in coal and provisions, with all
possible expedition, and then to proceed to join the fleet off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
mouth of the Canton River, placing himself under the orders of
the naval commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Great was now the rejoicing of both officers and men. Her
captain had already been made acquainted with his destination,
as far as Ceylon, before leaving England, but no one on board,
until now, had any certain information as to what particular service
they were to undertake afterwards. The road to distinction
was now made known to them; they were at once to be engaged
in active operations, in conjunction with her majesty's
forces.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the unremitted exertions of all on
board, the Nemesis could not be got ready to proceed on her
voyage in less than eight clear days from the time of her arrival
at Pointe de Galle. Added to this, the whole of the stores and
supplies had to be sent by land from Columbo, a distance of
seventy-two miles, as it was not then so well known that all
these things could be readily obtained at Singapore, and that
therefore a smaller quantity would have sufficed. Indeed, from
the more frequent communication with Ceylon, through vessels
touching at Pointe de Galle for supplies, which has since taken
place, every provision has now been made at that port, without
the necessity of sending for stores to so great a distance as
Columbo.</p>

<p>Under all circumstances, no time was to be lost; and the
anxiety to proceed on the voyage as quickly as possible was so
great, that Captain Hall determined to start off for Columbo the
same evening, in order to wait upon his Excellency the Governor,
and expedite the sending on of the requisite stores. A highly
respectable merchant, Mr. Gibb, who was going over, kindly
offered him a seat in his gig, and, after considerable exertion
and fatigue, they arrived at Columbo late on the following
evening.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the country presented itself in all
the rich tropical aspect of these regions. The whole road to
Columbo pointed out a fertile and luxuriant country, and was in
itself admirably adapted for travelling.</p>

<p>For my own part, the more I have seen of tropical countries,
the more I have everywhere been fascinated by their luxuriance,
and enjoyed the brilliancy of their skies. There is much to compensate
for the occasional oppression of the heat, which, after all,
is less troublesome or injurious than the chilling blasts of northern
climes; and, generally speaking, with proper <i>precaution</i>, it has
been hardly a question with myself whether the <i>average</i> degree of
health and buoyancy of spirits is not far greater than in less
favoured though more hardy regions. Every day that passes is
one in which you feel that you really live, for every thing around
you lives and thrives so beautifully. Nevertheless, it must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be forgotten that, after a few years spent in so relaxing a climate
the constitution becomes enfeebled, and is only to be restored by
a visit to more bracing regions.</p>

<p>Governor Mackenzie seemed to take much interest in the
steamer, and in her probable capabilities for the peculiar service
likely to be required of her in China; he had evidently made the
subject his study, and upon this, as upon other questions, evinced
great intelligence.</p>

<p>Little need here be said about the island of Ceylon, which has
been recently so well described and treated of by able and
well-informed writers. The fine fortifications of Columbo, (the
capital of the island,) the governor's palace, the barracks and
public offices, are all worth seeing; indeed, it is to be regretted
that arrangements have not yet been made, by which the
steamers from Calcutta to the Red Sea, touching at Point de
Galle, might allow some of their passengers, instead of wasting
the valuable time necessary for taking in fuel at Point de Galle,
to cross over to Columbo. The steamers might then, with a
very trifling additional expense, touch at Columbo to pick them
up, together with other passengers likely to be found there, now
that the overland route is daily becoming more frequented.</p>

<p>The most curious sight at Columbo is the little fleet of fishing-boats,
in the shape of long, narrow canoes, each made out of the
single trunk of a tree, with upper works rigged on to them,
falling in in such a way, that there is just sufficient room for a
man's body to turn round. They start off with the land-wind in
the morning, and run out a long distance to fish, returning again
with the sea-breeze in the afternoon. Both ends are made
exactly alike, so that, instead of going about, they have only to
shift the large lug-sail, the mast being in the middle, and it is
quite indifferent which end of the boat goes foremost. To counteract
the natural tendency of so narrow a body to upset, two
slight long spars are run out at the side, connected at the outer
ends by a long and stout piece of wood, tapering at either extremity,
not unlike a narrow canoe; this acts as a lever to keep
the boat upright, and is generally rigged out upon the windward
side. If the breeze freshens, it is easy to send a man or two out
upon it, as an additional counterpoise by their weight, and there
they sit, without any apparent apprehension.</p>

<p>The healthiness of Ceylon is within the last few years greatly
improved, principally owing to the extensive clearing of land
which has taken place. The plantations of coffee having been
found at one time, as indeed they are still, to yield a very large
profit, induced a great number of persons to enter into the speculation.
Land was readily purchased from government as quickly
as it could be obtained, at the rate of five shillings an acre; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the result has been a considerable increase in the exports of the
island, as well as an amelioration of its condition.</p>

<p>Coals, provisions, and stores of all kinds, were sent on board
the Nemesis with the utmost expedition, and, on the afternoon
of the 14th October, she was once more ready for sea. The
public interest in the events gradually growing up out of the
negotiations which were then being carried on with the Chinese
had gradually been raised to a high pitch, and a passage to
China, to join the force as a volunteer, was readily provided for
the governor's son, Lieutenant Mackenzie. Crowds of people
gathered upon the shore in all directions to witness her departure,
and the discharge of a few signal-rockets as soon as it was
dark added a little additional novelty to the event.</p>

<p>Ten days sufficed to carry the Nemesis to the island of
Penang, or Prince of Wales's island. Her passage had been
longer than might have been expected, owing in a great measure
to the badness of the coal, which caked and clogged up the
furnaces in such a way that, instead of requiring to be cleaned out
only once in about twenty-four hours, as would have been the case
with good coal, it was necessary to perform this process no less
than four times within the same period; added to which, the
enormous quantity of barnacles which adhered to her bottom
(a frequent source of annoyance before) greatly retarded her
progress.</p>

<p>The island of Penang, which lies close upon the coast of the
peninsula of Malacca, from which it is separated by a channel
scarcely more than two miles broad, would seem to be a place
particularly adapted for steamers to touch at. Indeed, it has
become a question of late whether it should not be provided with
a sort of government dockyard, for the repair of the increased
number of ships of war and transports, both belonging to the service
of government and the East India Company, which will necessarily
have to pass through the straits of Malacca, now that our
intercourse with China is so rapidly increasing. The harbour is
perfectly safe, the water at all times smooth; coals can easily be
stored there, and good wood can be obtained on the spot; moreover,
it lies directly in the track of ships, or very little out of it,
as they generally prefer passing on the Malacca side of the
straits, particularly during the south-west monsoon. The heavy
squalls which prevail on the opposite coast are so severe, that
they have at length taken its very name, and are called Sumatras.
They are accompanied with terrific lightning, which often does
great mischief, and they are justly looked upon with great
dread.</p>

<p>Penang is very properly considered one of the loveliest spots
in the eastern world, considering its limited extent; and, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the abundance and excellence of its spice productions, which
come to greater perfection in the straits than in any other part
in which they have been tried, (except, perhaps, in the island of
Java,) this little island has proved to be an extremely valuable
possession. It abounds in picturesque scenery, heightened by
the lovely views of the opposite coast of Malacca, called Province
Wellesley, which also belongs to the East India Company. The
numerous and excellent roads, the hospitality of the inhabitants,
and the richness of the plain, or belt, which lies between the
high, wooded mountains in the rear, and the town and harbour
are, perhaps, unequalled. This plain, together with the sides of
some of the adjoining mountains, is covered with luxuriant
plantations of nutmegs, cocoa-nut-trees, and spice-trees of all
kinds; and altogether Penang is one of the most attractive, as
it is also one of the healthiest spots in the East. It has by
some been even called the "Gem of the Eastern seas." There
is a fort not far from the fine, covered jetty, or landing-place, of
considerable strength; and, with very moderate trouble and expense,
there is little doubt that Penang could be made a valuable
naval depôt.</p>

<p>The short passage down the straits of Malacca, towards Singapore,
was easily performed in three days. But here again some
detention was inevitable. The north-east monsoon had already
fairly set in, and as vessels proceeding up the China Sea, at this
season, would have the wind directly against them, it was necessary
that the steamer should take in the greatest possible quantity
of fuel she could carry, before she could venture to leave Singapore.
On this occasion, every spare corner that could be found
was filled with coal, and even the decks were almost covered with
coal-bags. By this means, she was enabled to carry enough fuel
for full fifteen days' consumption, or about one hundred and
seventy-five tons.</p>

<p>The small island of Singapore being situated just off the
southern extremity of the peninsula of Malacca, from which it is
separated only by a very narrow strait, must necessarily lie almost
directly in the track of all vessels passing up or down the straits
of Malacca, either to or from China, or any of the intermediate
places. Being easy of access to all the numerous half-civilized
tribes and nations which inhabit the islands of those seas, and
within the influence of the periodical winds or monsoons which,
at certain seasons, embolden even the Chinese, Siamese, and
other nations to venture upon the distant voyage, it is not surprising
that in the space of a few years it should have risen to
a very high degree of importance as a commercial emporium.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the policy of Sir Stamford Raffles, in establishing
a free port in such an advantageous position, has been proved
beyond all previous anticipation. The perfect freedom of commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
intercourse, without any restriction or charges of any
kind, has given birth to a yearly increasing commercial spirit
among all the surrounding nations. It is impossible to see the
immense number of curious junks and trading-vessels which
arrive from all parts during the proper season, without admiring
the enterprising commercial spirit of all those different tribes,
and acknowledging the immense value to England of similar
distant outports, for the security and extension of her commerce.</p>

<p>The intercourse with Singapore has been rapidly increasing
every year, but especially since the commencement of the war in
China. Of course, all our ships of war and transports touch at
so convenient a place, where supplies of every description can
easily be obtained, and where every attention and kindness are
shewn to strangers, both by the authorities and by the resident
merchants. Much credit is due to the late governor, Mr. Bonham,
for the intelligence and activity which he exhibited, in everything
that could in any way forward the objects of the expedition, and
for the readiness with which he endeavoured to meet all the
wishes of those who were concerned in it. His hospitality and
personal attention was acknowledged by all.</p>

<p>In some respects, Singapore forms a good introduction to a
first visit to China. It has a very large Chinese population, (not
less than 20,000,) to which yearly additions are made, on the
arrival of the large trading junks, in which they come down
voluntarily to seek employment. Hundreds of them arrive in
the greatest destitution, without even the means of paying the
boat-hire to enable them to reach the shore, until they are hired
by some masters. They are the principal mechanics and
labourers of the town, and also act as household servants, while
many of them are employed in the cultivation of spices and of
sugar, or in clearing land. There is no kind of labour or employment
which a Chinaman will not readily undertake; and they
appear to succeed equally well in all, with the exception of
tending sheep or cattle, which is an occupation they are little
fond of.</p>

<p>The town has something of a Chinese aspect, from the number
of Chinamen who are employed in every capacity; and the
fruits and vegetables are principally cultivated and brought to
market by people of that nation. In Java, Penang, and elsewhere,
they are also to be met with in great numbers; which is
quite sufficient to prove (were proof wanting) how much they
are naturally disposed to become a colonizing people. There is
hardly any part of the world to which a Chinaman would refuse
to go, if led and managed by some of his own countrymen. But,
wherever they go, they carry the vice of <i>opium-smoking</i> with
them, and it is needless to say that it thrives at Singapore to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fullest extent, and that a large revenue is annually derived from
the monopoly of the sale of the drug.</p>

<p>The climate of Singapore is healthy, although the soil is wet,
owing to the constant rains; and the heat is, perhaps, never
excessive, although the place is situated only about seventy
miles from the equator.</p>

<p>It might be expected that the recent opening of the new
Chinese ports, from some of which large trading junks have
annually come down to seek their cargoes at Singapore, would
prove injurious to the future trade of the latter, since it would
no longer be necessary for the Chinese to go abroad to seek for
that which will now be brought to them at their own doors.
This apprehension, however, seems to be little entertained on
the spot, because there can be little doubt, that whatever tends
to augment the general foreign trade with China must benefit
Singapore, which lies on the highroad to it, to a greater or less
extent. Singapore has nothing to fear as regards its future
commercial prosperity, which is likely rather to increase than to
diminish, in consequence of the general increase of trade with
China and the neighbouring islands.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November, the Nemesis resumed her voyage,
and passed the little rocky island of Pedra Branca early on the
following morning. This dangerous and sometimes half-covered
rock lies nearly in the direct track for vessels proceeding up the
China Sea; and on its southern side are two dangerous ledges
or reefs, running out from it to the distance of more than a mile,
which, at high water, can scarcely be traced above the surface.
On the opposite, or northern side, there is deep water in not less
than sixteen or seventeen fathoms, close in to the rock; and,
moreover, the tides in its neighbourhood are very irregular, not
only in point of time, but also in direction and velocity. Nor
are these the only dangers to be met with in this locality.
Hence it will readily appear that a lighthouse placed upon Pedra
Branca would be of essential utility to all navigators who have
occasion to pass up or down the China Sea. A ship leaving
Singapore for Hong-Kong, for instance, might then start at
such an hour in the evening as would enable her to make the
light on Pedra Branca before morning; by which means, her
true position being ascertained, she might stand on without fear
of any danger. The expense of erecting the lighthouse would
not be great, as the elevation would only be moderate, and the
expense of maintaining it might be defrayed by levying a small
light-duty at Singapore upon all vessels passing up or down the
China Sea.</p>

<p>It has been often suggested that this would be a most advantageous
site for the proposed monument to the memory of the
distinguished Horsburgh, to whom too much honour cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
paid for his inestimable works, so much relied on by all navigators
who frequent the eastern seas. It would be difficult to
find a more advantageous or appropriate position, for the best of
all monuments to his fame, than this little, dangerous island of
Pedra Branca, situated as it is in the very centre of some of his
most valued researches; while the recent opening of the new
ports in China, and the possession of Hong-Kong, give an increased
importance to subjects connected with the navigation of
those seas. There is not a single vessel, either British or foreign,
which traverses those regions, which is not indebted to Horsburgh
for the instructions which render her voyage secure; and
a lighthouse upon Pedra Branca would do no less service to
navigators than it would honour to the memory of Horsburgh.</p>

<p>The Nemesis had now passed this rocky little island, and at
once found the full strength of the north-east monsoon blowing
steadily against her, so that "full steam" was necessary to enable
her to proceed. On the afternoon of the 16th, the high land of
the Spanish possessions of Luconia (better known by the name
of the capital town, Manilla) came in sight; and, on the following
morning, the Nemesis passed very near the port, but without
venturing to enter it, on account of the delay which it would
cause, although fuel was already much wanted.</p>

<p>The appearance of the island was very striking. Bold, picturesque
mountains, fine woods, with here and there a few sugar
plantations extending along the valleys, and rich, green, cocoa-nut
groves, to vary the prospect&mdash;all these combined, or alternating
with each other, made the aspect of the island very
attractive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no time could be spared to visit the interior of
the country, as the voyage had already been much protracted,
and the north-east monsoon was blowing directly against the
vessel. Her progress was therefore slow, and the want of fuel
began to be much felt.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the Lieu-chew Islands came in sight; but these
are not the same islands which were visited by Capt. Basil Hall,
whose descriptions excited so much attention.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>At daylight on the following morning, the 25th of November,
the Nemesis steamed through the Typa anchorage, which lies
opposite Macao, and ran close in to the town, where the water is
so shallow that none but trading-boats can venture so far. The
sudden appearance of so large and mysterious-looking a vessel
naturally excited the greatest astonishment among all classes,
both of the Portuguese and Chinese residents. The saluting of
the Portuguese flag, as she passed, sufficed to announce that
something unusual had happened; and crowds of people came
down to the Praya Grande, or Esplanade, to look at the first iron
steamer which had ever anchored in their quiet little bay. Her
very light draught of water seemed to them quite incompatible
with her size; and even the Portuguese governor was so much
taken by surprise, that he sent off a messenger expressly to the
vessel, to warn her captain of the supposed danger which he ran
by venturing so close in shore. It is probable, however, that his
excellency was not quite satisfied with the near approach of an
armed steamer, within a short range of his own palace; and,
moreover, the firing of a salute, almost close under his windows,
had speedily frightened away the fair ladies who had been observed
crowding at all the windows with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>As soon as the first excitement had passed, Captain Hall
waited upon the governor, to assure him that he had come with
the most peaceable intentions, and to thank his excellency for
the friendly warning he had given, with respect to the safety of
the vessel. At the same time, he begged to inform his excellency,
that he was already thoroughly acquainted with the harbour
and anchorage of Macao, from early recollection of all those
localities, as he had served as midshipman on board the Lyra,
during Lord Amherst's embassy to China, in 1816.</p>

<p>It was now ascertained that the English admiral, the Hon.
George Elliot, was at anchor with his fleet in Tongkoo roads,
below the Bogue forts; and, accordingly, the Nemesis proceeded
to join the squadron, after the delay of only a few hours. Her
arrival was announced by the salute to the admiral's flag, which
was immediately returned by the Melville, precisely as if the
Nemesis had been a regular man-of-war.</p>

<p>The Nemesis now found herself in company with the three
line-of-battle ships, Wellesley, Melville, and Blenheim, together
with H.M.S. Druid, Herald, Modeste, Hyacinth, and the Jupiter
troop-ship. Thus, then, after all her toil and hardships,
the gallant Nemesis had at length reached the proud post
towards which she had so long been struggling. Her voyage
from England had, indeed, been a long one, very nearly eight
months having elapsed since she bade adieu to Portsmouth.
But her trials had been many during that period. She had
started in the worst season of the year, and had encountered,
throughout nearly the whole voyage, unusual weather and unforeseen
difficulties. She had happily survived them all, and
the efforts which had been already made to enable her to earn
for herself a name gave happy promise of her future destiny.</p>

<p>The excitement on board was general, now that she at length
found her <i>iron</i> frame swinging, side by side, with the famed
"wooden walls" of England's glory; and the prospect of immediate
service, in active operations against the enemy, stimulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the exertions of every individual. For some days, however, she
was compelled to content herself with the unwelcome operation
of "coaling" in Tongkoo Bay. In the meantime, the ships of
war had sailed, leaving her to follow them as soon as she could
be got ready; and now, while this black and tedious process is
going on, we cannot be better employed than in taking a short
survey of the events which had immediately preceded her arrival,
and of the more important occurrences which led to such
momentous consequences.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>The abolition of the privileges of the East India Company in
China, and the difficulties which soon resulted therefrom, concerning
the mode of conducting our negotiations with the Chinese,
will be remembered by most readers; and, whatever part the
questions arising out of the trade in opium, may have <i>afterwards</i>
borne in the complication of difficulties, there is little doubt that
the first germ of them all was developed at the moment when
the general trade with China became free. This freedom of
trade, too, was forced upon the government and the company in
a great degree, by the competition of the American interests;
and by the fact, that British trade came to be carried on partly
under the American flag, and through American agency, because
it was prevented from being brought into fair competition in the
market, under the free protection of its own flag.</p>

<p>The unhappy death of the lamented Lord Napier, principally
occasioned by the ill treatment of the Chinese, and the mental
vexation of having been compelled to submit to the daily insults
of the Chinese authorities, in his attempts to carry out the orders
of his government, will be remembered with deep regret. With
the nature of those orders we have here nothing to do. No one
can question Lord Napier's talent, energy, and devotedness to the
object of his mission.</p>

<p>The attempts of Captain Elliot, when he afterwards took upon
himself the duties of chief superintendent, to carry out the same
instructions, were scarcely less unfortunate. And finding, as he
publicly stated, that "the governor had declined to accede to the
conditions involved in the instructions which he had received
from her majesty's government, concerning the manner of his
<i>intercourse</i> with his Excellency," the British flag was struck at
the factories at Canton, on the 2nd of December, 1837, and her
majesty's principal superintendent retired to Macao.</p>

<p>During the year 1838, very serious and determined measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
began to be adopted by the Chinese authorities, directed generally
against the trade in opium; and imperial edicts threatened death
as the punishment, for both the dealers in, and the smokers of
the drug. Several unfortunate Chinese were executed in consequence.
Attempts were now made to execute the criminals in
front of the foreign factories along the river side, contrary to all
former usage and public right. A remonstrance followed, addressed
to the governor, who, in reply, gave them a sort of moral
lecture, instead of a political lesson, and, then, condescendingly
admitted, that "foreigners, though born and brought up beyond
the pale of civilization, must yet have human hearts."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the following December, 1838, the insulting
attempt was again repeated, close under the American flag-staff,
which was not then placed, as it has since been, in an enclosure,
surrounded with a brick wall, and high paling. The flag was
immediately hauled down by the consul, in consequence of the
preparations which were going on, for the erection of the cross
upon which the criminal was to be strangled.</p>

<p>At first, a few foreigners interfered, and, without violence, induced
the officers to desist from their proceedings. But, gradually,
the crowd increased, and, a Chinese mob, when excited, is fully
as unruly as an English one; and, thus, each imprudent act, as
usual, led to another. No Chinese authorities were at hand to
control the disturbance; stones began to fly in all directions;
and the foreigners, who, by this time, had come forward, to the
aid of their brethren, were at length, through the increasing
numbers of the mob, fairly driven to take refuge in the neighbouring
factories. Here they were obliged to barricade the doors
and windows, many of which, were, nevertheless, destroyed, and
the buildings endangered, before a sufficient force of Chinese
soldiers had arrived to disperse the mob. In the evening, however,
quiet was perfectly restored.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the alarm had spread to Whampoa, whence
Captain Elliot set out, accompanied by about one hundred and
twenty armed men, for Canton, and arrived at the British factory
late in the evening. Both parties were now clearly placed in a
false position, yet one which it would have been very difficult to
have avoided. During many preceding months, the unfortunate
Hong merchants had been in constant collision with their own
government on the one hand, and with the foreign merchants,
on the other. There was scarcely any species of indignity, to
which they were not exposed, and they were even threatened with
death itself. The Chinese government had daily become more
overbearing towards all foreigners; and its habitual cold and
haughty tone had grown into undisguised contempt and unqualified
contumely. Their treatment of Lord Napier had been
considered on their part as a <i>victory</i>; and their successful repulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of all Captain Elliot's advances, was viewed by them as an evidence
of their own power, and of Great Britain's weakness.</p>

<p>It has been already stated in the first chapter, that Sir Frederick
Maitland, who had a short time previously paid a visit to China,
in a line of battle ship, had left those seas altogether, just before
the collision took place; and, in proportion as the foreigners were
left unprotected, so did the Chinese become more overbearing.</p>

<p>At the same time, it cannot be denied, that their determination
to put a stop, as far as possible, to the opium-trade, <i>was for the
time sincere</i>; though their measures might have been hasty and
unwarrantable. A few days after the preceding disturbance,
Captain Elliot distinctly ordered, that "all British owned
schooners, or other vessels, habitually, or occasionally engaged
in the illicit opium traffic, <i>within</i> the Bocca Tigris, should remove
before the expiration of three days, and not again return within
the Bocca Tigris, being so engaged." And they were, at the
same time, distinctly warned, that if "any British subjects were
feloniously to cause the death of any Chinaman, in consequence
of persisting in the trade within the Bocca Tigris, he would be
liable to capital punishment; that no owners of such vessels, so
engaged, would receive any assistance or interposition from the
British government, in case the Chinese government should seize
any of them; and, that all British subjects, employed in these
vessels, would be held responsible for any consequences which
might arise from forcible resistance offered to the Chinese government,
in the same manner as if such resistance were offered to
their own or any other government, in their own or in any foreign
country."</p>

<p>So far Captain Elliot evinced considerable energy and determination;
but he, probably, had scarcely foreseen that the shrewd
and wily government of China would very soon put the question
to him, "if you can order the discontinuance of the traffic <i>within</i>
the Bocca Tigris, why can you not also put an end to it <i>in the
outer waters beyond the Bogue</i>?"</p>

<p>As it seems scarcely possible to avoid all direct allusion to the
difficult question of the traffic in opium, I shall take this opportunity
of saying a few words upon this important subject. A
detailed account of its remarkable history, and of the vicissitudes
which attended it, both within and without the Chinese empire,
would afford matter of the greatest interest, but could hardly find
a place in this work.</p>

<p>In former times, as is well known, opium was admitted into
China as a drug, upon payment of duty; and, even the prohibition
which was ultimately laid upon it, was regarded by the
Chinese themselves as a mere dead letter. Indeed, precisely in
proportion to the difficulty of obtaining the drug, did the longing
for it increase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The great events which sprang out of this appetite of a whole
nation for "forbidden fruit," on the one hand, and of the <i>temptations</i>
held out to foreigners to furnish it to them, on the other,
may be considered as one of those momentous crises in a nation's
history, which seem almost pre-ordained, as stages or epochs to
mark the world's progress.</p>

<p>It is curious enough, that, at the very time when a <i>mercantile</i>
crisis was growing up at Canton, a <i>political</i> intrigue, or, as it
might be called, a cabinet crisis, was breaking out at Pekin. In
fact, strange as it may appear, it is believed in China, upon
tolerably good authority, that there was actually a reform party
struggling to shew its head at Pekin, and, that the question of
more extended intercourse with foreigners, was quite as warmly
discussed as that of the prohibition of the import of opium,
or of the export of silver.</p>

<p>Memorials were presented to the emperor on both sides of the
question; and his Majesty Taou-kwang, being old, and personally
of feeble character, halted for a time "between two opinions,"
alternately yielding both to the one and to the other, until he at
length settled down into his old bigotry against <i>change</i>, and felt
all the native prejudices of a true son of Han, revive more
strongly than ever within his bosom.</p>

<p>But the question of the Opium-trade, or Opium laws, which
for some time had been almost a <i>party</i> matter, like the corn
laws in our own country, became at length a question of interest
and importance to the whole nation, and was magnified in its
relations by the very discussion of the points which it involved.</p>

<p>It is said that the head of the reform party (if it can so be
called) in China was a Tartar lady, belonging to the emperor's
court, remarkable for her abilities no less than her personal
attractions, and possessed of certain very strong points of character,
which made her as much feared by some as she was loved
by others. She was soon raised even to the throne itself, as the
emperor's wife, but lived only a few years to enjoy her power.
Her influence soon came to be felt throughout the whole of that
vast empire; it was the means of rewarding talent, and of detecting
inability. She seemed to possess, in a marked degree, that
intuitive discernment which sometimes bursts upon the female
mind as if by inspiration. The tone and energy of her character
were in advance of her age and of her country. She had many
grateful friends, but she had raised up for herself many bitter
enemies; party feeling ran high, and became at length too
powerful even for an empress.</p>

<p>Gradually her influence diminished, the favour of the emperor
declined, her opponent again got the upper hand, and at length
she pined away under the effects of disappointment, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
injustice, and died. But her influence, so long as it lasted, was
unbounded, and was felt through every province.</p>

<p>Her principal adherents and dependents naturally lost their
power when that of their mistress was gone. The question of
more extended trade with foreigners was now again set aside;
the old feelings of bigotry and national pride resumed even more
than their former vigour. Opium at once became the instrument,
but ostensibly <span class="smcap">PATRIOTISM</span> became the groundwork of their
measures. The old national feeling against foreigners throughout
the empire was revived; and in the midst of it all, as if
ordained to hasten on the momentous crisis which waited for its
fulfilment, <i>the son of the emperor himself died in his very palace,
from the effects of the excessive use of opium.</i></p>

<p>Even before this unfortunate event, strong measures had
began to be adopted in some parts of the empire against the
preparers and smokers of the drug. As is usually the case when
one party has become victorious over another after a severe
struggle, the course which they advocate is followed up with
even more than their former vigour. When once the advocates
of a severe compulsion for stopping the use of opium, and with
it the export of silver, had gained the upper hand in the cabinet,
measures of a very stringent kind were immediately adopted, as
if with the full determination of giving them a fair trial.</p>

<p>The evil had certainly reached a very high pitch; and from
having been formerly confined to the wealthier and more indolent
classes, it spread its deadly grasp among the lower grades,
so that even <i>the lowest</i> at length came to be confirmed debauchees.
Not that their fair earnings could generally enable
them to procure enough of so costly an article, but because they
were led to deprive themselves and their families of other comforts,
and even necessaries, in order to obtain the means of
gratifying their irresistible longing for the poison. Not unfrequently
was even crime itself committed in order to obtain the
means; and the opium shops, particularly in the maritime towns
and villages, became the last resort of all the thieves, vagabonds,
gamblers, and bad characters throughout the district.</p>

<p>The demand for opium, and consequently its price, increased
remarkably, and the numerous statements which have been published
under this head have not been by any means exaggerated.
It penetrated the most secret haunts, in proportion as the danger
of using it more publicly increased; and the more numerous
were the edicts which were issued against it, the greater did the
craving for the forbidden luxury, amounting almost to a national
<span class="smcap">MANIA</span>, go on increasing day by day. The moral lectures of the
emperor, which appeared in the Pekin Gazette, were very pretty
to read, but very futile in their effects. And if the great despotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ruler over hundreds of millions of people, whose very word was
law, still found himself totally unable to exclude the drug (even
under the severest prohibitions) from his <i>own palace</i>, is it to be
wondered at that all his strongest measures should have totally
failed in withdrawing the mass of the nation from the temptation?</p>

<p>The enormous profits derived from the clandestine sale of
opium induced many of the Chinese to embark in it as a speculation,
who neither used it themselves, nor were habituated to
any other commercial traffic. Official men both smoked and
<i>sold it</i>; hundreds of people gained a livelihood by the manufacture
or sale of opium-pipes, and other apparatus connected
with its use; and even the armed soldier often carried an opium-pipe
in his girdle, with the same unconcern as he did the fan-case
which is very commonly a part of his costume.</p>

<p>All this was going on throughout a great portion of the empire
during the time that the question of its legalization or of
its sterner prohibition was being so warmly debated at court, and
discussed throughout the country. But the general impression
was, that the importation of the drug would be legalized, and
there was little apprehension of the violent persecution which
soon commenced.</p>

<p>Instead of the foreigners imposing upon them the barter of
opium as a condition of trade, it was the Chinese themselves
who begged and prayed that it might be supplied to them; who
sought out the opium-selling vessels at long distances, and were
even then only permitted to receive it by paying hard cash for
it. So determined were the Chinese to possess it at any cost,
that they frequently were willing to purchase it for <i>its own weight</i>
in silver, balanced fairly the one against the other in the scales.
Boats belonging to the Custom House engaged in the traffic.
The governor of Canton himself, Tang by name, was known to
have employed his own boat to fetch it; and so publicly and
undisguisedly was the traffic carried on, that a stipulated sum
was paid to the officers for every chest landed, precisely as if it
had been a bale of cotton or a box of glass.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, however, that after the death of the
emperor's son, public attention throughout the empire became
more strongly than ever directed to the increasing evils of the
use and abuse of opium. Many instances of its pernicious
effects now rose to the recollection of individuals who would
otherwise have scarcely dwelt upon them. The agitation of the
question had indeed led to party feeling upon the subject. The
thunders of the emperor against foreigners began to take effect;
measures of a severer kind now began to be adopted; and the
reaction throughout the empire was almost universal. The
shock had not been expected, and it came upon them like an
earthquake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the justice of it appeared evident to many, for the evils
had been concealed from none. It seemed as if all on a sudden
the highroad to official favour and distinction could be found
solely through the degree of energy shewn in ferreting out the
lowest opium-smokers, and in publicly giving up the very pipes
which were used; indeed it has been said that this enthusiasm
was carried so far, that pipes were actually <i>purchased</i> for the
purpose of giving them up to the officers, as if it indicated a
voluntary surrender of a vicious habit. These were all displayed
as emblems of victory, and the most zealous were the best rewarded,
while the government itself became astonished at its
own apparent success. It now thought itself irresistible, and
despised the foreigners more than ever.</p>

<p>A grand crisis was produced by these proceedings in the interior
of the country. <i>All traffic</i> of an extensive kind became
nearly stopped; the prisons were filled with delinquents; and a
great parade was made of the "stern severity" of the government,
on the one hand, and of the obedient submission of the
people, on the other. Yet, in spite of all this public display,
that traffic itself was in reality as flourishing as ever, although
perhaps it might have changed hands. Opium was more eagerly
sought after than before; the price of it rose in proportion; and,
precisely as had been predicted by the free trade or reform party
in Pekin, it was found impossible to prevent its introduction into
the country by the people themselves, even by the threat of death
itself. Fishermen carried with them a single ball, and made a
large profit by its sale; in short, the temptations and the profits
were so large and irresistible, that hundreds of modes were discovered
for conveying it from place to place, in spite of the
penalties which awaited detection. The beheading of a few men,
and the imprisonment of others, did not deter the mass; the
delicious intoxication of the precious drug proved far too attractive
to be controlled by the horrors of death or torture.</p>

<p>The truth is, however specious the edicts and writings of the
Chinese may appear <i>on paper</i>, they are perfectly futile in reality,
when the will of the people and the absence of any early prejudice
is opposed to their accomplishment.</p>

<p>Without further pursuing a subject which, though deeply
interesting, has been already so much a matter of discussion, we
may at once come to the conclusion, that the passion of the
Chinese for the pernicious intoxication of opium, was the first
link in the chain which was destined to connect them at some
future day with all the other families of mankind. The abolition
of the privileges of the East India Company first opened the
door for the <i>general</i> trade of all foreign nations upon an extended
scale; but the trade in opium, which the Chinese were
determined to carry on, in spite of all opposition of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
government, and with a full knowledge of the pernicious consequences
which resulted from it, was the <i>instrument</i> by means
of which the haughty tone and the inapproachable reserve of
their government were to be at length overcome.</p>

<p>We now come to the period of the famous Commissioner Lin's
appointment to Canton. This was indeed the climax of all the
perplexities. Lin himself was the Robespierre, the terrorist, the
reckless despot, who represented a certain party in the empire,
who conscientiously believed that they could <i>terrify</i> not only
their own countrymen, but even foreign nations, into patient
submission to their will.</p>

<p>This singular man seems to have been composed of good and
bad qualities in equal proportions, but always of a violent kind.
In any other country than China, he would have been either
distinguished as a demagogue or branded as a tyrant, precisely
as circumstances chanced to lead him into a particular channel.
He was reckless of consequences, so long as he could carry out
his will without control. He was violent, yet not selfish;
changeable, yet always clinging to his original views; severe,
and even cruel and inexorable, in the measures by which he
sought to gain his ends; yet, in reality, he is believed to have
meant well for his country, and to have had the interests and
the wishes of the emperor, his master, always at heart. He
certainly believed that he could control both the people under
his own government, and the foreigners who came into contact
with them, <i>by force</i>; and his very errors seem to have arisen
from excess of zeal in the cause which he adopted. His talent
was unquestionable.</p>

<p>Lin became intoxicated with his own success (for the time, at
all events) in whatever he undertook; and expected all his orders
to be executed with the same energy and facility with which he
gave them utterance. It is said, moreover, that he procured a
copy of a remarkable work called a "Digest of Foreign Customs,
Practices, Manners," &amp;c., in which bad deeds rather than good
ones, and even the names of individual merchants, were brought
forward; and that he studied this book with constant pleasure.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, 1839, this redoubtable commissioner
reached Canton, having travelled with extraordinary speed from
Pekin, whither he had been called to receive his appointment at
the hands of the emperor himself; who is said to have even shed
tears, as he parted with him.</p>

<p>He lost not a moment, upon his arrival at Canton, in setting
all the powerful energies of his mind to work, to devise means of
accomplishing his ends. He determined to endeavour to put
a complete stop to the traffic in opium, both on the part of
his own people and on that of foreigners; and his great aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was to "control, curb, and humble," the foreign community
generally.</p>

<p>From this time forth, it became very evident, that great and
complicated events must be looked for upon the political horizon.
Even Captain Elliot himself could hardly hope that his little
star of diplomacy could light the road to a solution of the difficulties,
without an ultimate resort to arms.</p>

<p>It is true, that for a brief interval previous to Lin's arrival, the
prospect seemed to brighten considerably. Captain Elliot had
partially succeeded in establishing direct official intercourse with
the governor of Canton; for it had been at length agreed, that
all sealed communications coming from the chief superintendent,
should be delivered into the hands of the governor, and the seal
broken by him only. This was a great point gained; and Elliot
seems to have managed it with considerable tact. Nevertheless,
the correspondence could not be said even now, to be carried on
upon terms of "perfect equality;" and even this concession was
quite as much a matter of necessity to the governor, as it was to
Captain Elliot; for the cessation of intercourse had been a source
of equal embarrassment to them both.</p>

<p>This Governor Tang was a crafty, cringing, self-interested
man; he derived immense sums from opium, and his own son
was said to be employed in the clandestine traffic, against which,
the father was uttering severe denunciations, followed by severer
persecutions.</p>

<p>Lin afterwards suspected, and, perhaps, even discovered his
delinquencies; and Tang became a willing and submissive instrument,
if not a cringing sycophant. But his day of punishment
came at last.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>It is worthy of notice that, just previous to the arrival of Commissioner
Lin at Canton, the opium-trade had received such a
check, that it might be said to have been for the time almost
entirely suspended. We have seen the strong measures taken
by Captain Elliot against it, which proved that he looked upon
it with no favouring eye; and, in short, at that time the opium
vessels had left the river altogether. But Lin was not a man to
do things by halves. He had formerly, when governor of a province,
earned the character of the people's friend; and he
seemed now more determined still to win the appellation of the
foreigner's enemy. He had belonged to the party opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the empress's influence, and, had she survived and continued in
power, he would never have been sent on so dangerous a mission.
But, when once the liberal party, and the advocates for the
legalization of the opium trade, upon the grounds of the <i>impossibility</i>
of excluding it by prohibition, had been defeated, it
became almost a point of honour, certainly of pride with Lin, to
shew how successfully he could carry out the views of the high
Chinese, or exclusive party.</p>

<p>From the very moment of Lin's arrival, clothed with unlimited
power, his restless energy, and his quick penetrating eye, made
every officer of his government cower down before him. Indeed,
there was hardly an officer of the province, from the governor
downwards, who did not feel conscious of guilt, corruption, and
peculation. From high to low, from rich to poor, Lin determined
that a reign of terror should commence. He had lists prepared,
containing observations upon the characters of all the public
officers, of the Hong merchants, and even of the foreigners. He
seemed determined to wage war with everybody. And, as a
proof that his intentions against the foreign community were
anything but conciliatory, within a few days after his arrival he
sent round the Hong merchants to the different factories, to
ascertain, by intrigue and persuasion, <i>what weapons the foreigners
were in possession of</i>, and what means they had at hand for their
own immediate defence.</p>

<p>Having privately arranged all his plans, and, believing that
the foreigners were sleeping, Lin now ordered that all the opium
in the inner waters, and also in the store ships in the "<i>outer
waters</i>," should be given up to the officers of his government;
and that a bond should be drawn up in "Chinese and foreign
character, stating clearly that the ships afterwards to arrive there
shall never, to all eternity, dare to bring any opium; or, if they
did so, that their whole cargo should be confiscated, and all their
people put to death, [by <i>Chinese</i> officers,] and, moreover, that
they would willingly undergo it as the penalty of their crime."</p>

<p>This proclamation certainly caused a little panic in Canton,
and it was precisely what the commissioner desired; and, the
more the foreign merchants seemed disposed to meet his excellency's
views, as far as lay in their power, so much the more did
the demands of the commissioner rise. Every concession on the
part of Captain Elliot, or the merchants, was to him a victory
gained, and the forerunner of greater ones. Threats thundered
forth against the heads of the Hong merchants rebounded in
threats of all sorts, and alarming statements from them to the
foreigners.</p>

<p>There seems to be some reason for supposing that, in the
commencement of the business, it was intended by Lin that a
certain compensation should be granted to foreigners for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
value of the opium surrendered. Gradually, however, as he
thought himself getting stronger, this intention was quite lost
sight of; and almost at the same time an edict came out, forbidding
all foreigners to apply for permission to go down to Macao&mdash;in
fact, preventing them from leaving Canton or Whampoa.</p>

<p>At this period, not ten days had elapsed since Lin's arrival at
Canton, and there had not been sufficient time even to reply to
his proclamation, <i>only issued the preceding day</i>, respecting the
opium and the bond. Lin's impatience hurried on one event
upon another, in his headlong career; he issued orders, without
waiting to see whether his previous ones had been attended to.
Whatever unfortunate results may have ultimately sprung from
his policy, it can never be questioned that for the time his darling
object was, not only to "humble the foreigners," but to carry
out, to the letter, the express directions of his Emperor, which
were delivered to him in these words:&mdash;"to scrub and wash
away the filth, and to cut up the opium-evil by the roots, and to
remove calamities from the people."</p>

<p>Within a few days after his arrival, we have seen that Lin was
embroiled with the whole foreign community; and, in the short
space of twenty-four hours, edicts appeared, as has been stated,
commanding the surrender of all the opium, whether strictly in
the Chinese waters or not; and placing under arrest every
foreigner, both at Canton and Whampoa, without alleging any
grounds for the proceeding.</p>

<p>The drama was now fast spreading out into its different acts
and scenes. An agreement that one thousand chests should be
delivered up, only led to the demand for more, and <i>four</i> thousand
chests were then required.</p>

<p>Next, Mr. Dent, one of the principal merchants, was to be
brought before the commissioner <i>within</i> the city; and, in order
to save, as he believed, the heads of some of the Hong merchants,
he agreed that he would go, provided that he should
receive beforehand a safe-conduct from the imperial commissioner
himself, guaranteeing his safe return; but upon any
other condition he refused to put himself voluntarily in his
power. The reply to this was, "that, if he did not come of his
own free will, he should be dragged out of his house by force;"
and the threat was added, that, in that case, the high commissioner
would assuredly kill him.</p>

<p>A circular from Captain Elliot now required that "all ships
belonging to her Majesty's subjects at the outer anchorages
should proceed at once to Hong-Kong, since her Majesty's subjects
were then detained at Canton against their will." It will
scarcely be credited, that at this time the only British man-of-war
in the Chinese waters was the small sloop, the Larne. This
was perfectly well known to the Chinese, who, consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
conceived themselves strong enough to proceed to the highest
degree of violence and indignity. And, when the Larne afterwards
went up to the Bogue, and demanded certain explanations
of the Admiral Kwan, (who, we have before seen, was on friendly
terms with Sir Frederick Maitland, on a previous occasion, when
he visited the Bogue in a <i>line-of-battle ship</i>,) the only answer
that Kwan condescended to give to the <i>little</i> Larne was, "that
she (or rather her captain) ought to know her own weakness, and
be reverentially obedient, as Maitland had been before."</p>

<p>At the critical juncture I have above described, Captain Elliot
resolved to come up to the British factory in person, in a small
open boat, and, for a moment, our flag was again hoisted, when
all were virtually prisoners, whom the flag could not protect.
He now declared his intention of demanding passports for all
her Majesty's subjects within <i>ten days</i>&mdash;(should he not have
demanded them <i>at once</i>?) but, having no armed force that he
could call to his aid, all he could do was to say, "that, if they
were refused for the period of three days after his application, he
should be forced into the conclusion that British subjects were
all to be violently detained as hostages, in order that they might
be intimidated into unworthy concessions."</p>

<p>Lin now had Elliot completely in his power, and was doubtless
much surprised himself at the success of all his schemes.
At that moment, neither the flag nor the guns of England could
protect her people: they were prisoners in their own halls; and
it is a positive fact that, for some time, the only chance of relief
or protection which they had to look to, was the expected arrival
of two <i>American ships of war</i>, which were known to be on their
way out, having been applied for by the consul of that country,
upon the first appearance of the difficulties.</p>

<p>This was a grand opportunity for pushing their fortunes in
that quarter, which the Americans knew well how to profit by.
In reality, the whole foreign trade was for a time in jeopardy;
but the Americans profited precisely in proportion to the increase
of our difficulties, and their trade increased exactly as ours declined.
The moment was an advantageous one for proving to
the Chinese that Americans were not Englishmen; although
they cleverly made them understand that they <i>had been</i> so once,
but at last had conquered for themselves a name, a flag, and a
nation.</p>

<p>It has been said that, at a later period, an American merchant
had more than one interview with Lin, in which various suggestions
were made as to the measures to be adopted; but, whether
they were of a favourable or unfavourable nature to English
interests, it is impossible to say with confidence. The results of
the conference were kept very secret.</p>

<p>Having secured all the foreigners within his grasp, Lin's next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
step was to withdraw all the native servants from the factories,
and to forbid the sale of provisions to foreigners in any shape.
Armed men were posted on every side, to prevent any one from
attempting to escape, while the river was blockaded, and all the
foreign boats which could be found were drawn up high and dry
on shore, or else destroyed. In the meantime, however, no provisions
were supplied by Lin himself; consequently, the foreign
prisoners were in a worse plight, in that respect, than the actual
malefactors in the cells of the public prisons of the town; and
his object was evidently to <i>starve</i> them into compliance with his
wishes, if, indeed, he knew himself what the full extent of his
wishes really was.</p>

<p>Captain Elliot was now called upon to deliver up <i>all</i> the
opium, wherever it might be found. And yet it was clear enough
that Captain Elliot could not possibly know <i>where</i> all the opium
was, or how much it might be; and, having already agreed to
the demand for, first, one thousand, and then four thousand
chests, it would clearly be necessary to stipulate some quantity
as a satisfactory equivalent for all.</p>

<p>Even in their present dilemma a more decided show of firmness,
and a threat of the retribution which would fall upon him
hereafter for his violent proceedings, might, possibly, have
restored to the commissioner some little portion of his reasonableness,
if not his reason. Nevertheless, as the whole community
of foreigners (not the English only) were now under a
course of starvation and imprisonment, and were in a degraded
position in the eyes of all Chinamen, it is difficult to say if any
other course could have been adopted than the one chosen by
Captain Elliot. A bond was signed, under the influence and by
the compulsion of existing circumstances, by all the parties, that
they would not deal any more in opium; but they did not accede
to the penalty of death, &amp;c. &amp;c., which Lin had originally attempted
to impose. And, at the requisition of Captain Elliot,
they agreed to deliver up all the opium then in their <i>possession</i>,
"for the service of her Majesty's government."</p>

<p>The quantity of opium to be delivered was not stipulated at
the time. But, after returns had been very honourably and
equitably sent to Captain Elliot, it appeared that he could command
the enormous quantity of 20,283 chests; and he accordingly
agreed that that immense number should be delivered up
to officers deputed by Lin to receive it. It was also stipulated
that, as soon as one-fourth should be given up, the servants
should be restored; that, after one-half had been delivered, the
passage-boats should run as usual down to Macao; that trade
should be opened as soon as three-fourths had been given up;
and that, when the whole of it had been surrendered, "things
should go on as usual."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>As yet scarcely three weeks had elapsed since Commissioner
Lin had come down, with this enormous power upon his shoulders;
and yet it had sufficed to enable him to effect this vast
change in the relations which existed between the Chinese and
the foreign community, and to astonish even his own countrymen
by the energy and rashness of his measures.</p>

<p>The commissioner was perfectly surprised at his own success,
and equally so at the enormous quantity of opium which Elliot
declared himself able to procure. But, in point of fact, there
were not so many as 20,000 chests of opium in the "<i>Chinese
waters</i>" at that time, although that amount was at last procured,
for vessels were sent to a distance even to seek for it, and to
purchase it for Captain Elliot. Some of it was lying at Manilla,
whence it was brought over for the purpose.</p>

<p>The next step in Lin's political delinquency was, that he broke
the very agreement he had just made; and, instead of allowing
the passage-boats to pass down to Macao, as usual, as soon as
one-half of the stipulated number of chests had been surrendered,
as agreed, he selected the names of sixteen gentlemen out of the
whole community, and issued the strictest orders against <i>their</i>
departure; and directed that every one of the passage-boats
should be examined, to see if any of these gentlemen were on
board, and to prevent their escape.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at this time the commissioner would seem to
have had some misgivings about the posture of affairs, and
became at one time inclined to recommend the "obedient"
foreigners to the notice of the Emperor, for the purpose of
having some mark of favour conferred upon them. This was
thought to point at some kind of compensation for the value of
the opium surrendered, but nothing further was heard of it.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May, 1839, the last portion of the stipulated
quantity of 20,283 chests of opium was delivered up at the
Bogue, where the rest of it was stored, awaiting the Imperial
pleasure. Many questions arose as to how it was to be disposed
of, but at last Lin himself hit upon the clever expedient of
destroying it by lime and oil, in pits dug for the purpose, and
then pouring the fluid compound into the sea. Double guards
were placed to prevent any of the drug from being stolen, and
death was to be the punishment of every delinquent. There
were checks and spies in all directions, and the process of destruction
was carried on with great parade. Nevertheless, it is
believed that some of it was purloined, both on shore and on its
way from the ships to the landing-place, where mandarin-boats
and war-junks were collected in great number.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after he had regained his liberty, Captain
Elliot sent intelligence of all these occurrences to Bombay, (for
the overland mail,) by a fast sailing vessel, hired expressly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the purpose, called the Ariel; and, at the same time, H.M. sloop
Larne was despatched to Calcutta, to report them to the governor-general
of India. Consequently, there was then <i>not a single
British ship of war</i> of any description in the Chinese waters, for
the protection of British life and property. Luckily, the arrival
soon afterwards of the American ships of war, the Columbia and
the John Adams, served to reassure the drooping spirits of the
whole foreign community.</p>

<p>Other acts of atrocity and bad faith had also been committed
by the Chinese authorities; but it is remarkable that Captain
Elliot, whose personal courage and natural ability have never
been questioned, seems to have entered no public protest, nor
addressed any strong remonstrance to the commissioner, either
upon this subject, or upon that of his own imprisonment, or
rather confinement, at Canton. The probability is, that he
thought it useless to do so, unless he were prepared to back his
remonstrance by a demonstration of force. Nevertheless, after
the foreigners were released, he issued a notice that all trade on
the part of his countrymen with the Chinese should be stopped.
And this notice was repeated in still stronger terms after the
departure of the Larne; for he declared that "he saw no prospect
of such an arrangement of existing difficulties as to admit
of British ships proceeding within the Bocca Tigris, under the
sanction of his authority, until the opinion of her Majesty's
government could be made known to him." And at a later
period, he thought it necessary to warn all the merchants, (dated
the 29th of July,) "that he had moved her Majesty's and the
Indian governments to forbid the admission of tea and other
produce from China into Great Britain and India, during the
existence of the preceding prohibition in Canton, unless their
manifests were signed in his presence."</p>

<p>The stoppage of the trade by Captain Elliot irritated Lin
excessively. It was turning the tables against himself, defeating
him with his own weapons; it savoured of presumption in his
sight; and, moreover, it materially diminished his revenue. It
proved that, however bombastic and ridiculous their professions
of <i>indifference</i> to the trade of foreigners might be, they really
stood very much in need of it themselves, and, in fact, they felt
the stoppage of it on our part quite as much as we ever did on
theirs. It made Lin actually spiteful; he tried every art to
induce the English to act <i>contrary</i> to Elliot's orders; and, subsequently,
when he went down to Macao to see with his own
eyes what the Portuguese were about, he went so far as to make
it a matter of accusation against Elliot, that "he had <i>prevented</i>
the merchant ships of his country from entering the port of
Canton."</p>

<p>Such gross inconsistency, probably, was never before presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to view in so short a period of time by any public man. Lin
was, in fact, completely at bay, and he, moreover, had probably
heard by this time that more than one British man-of war was
expected. Nevertheless, he by no means relaxed in his feelings
of bitter hostility; he listened to everything that was said or
written against the English and against opium; he so alarmed
the Portuguese, as to make them expel all the English, out of
the town, (or, what is the same thing, he threatened to attack
the town if the English remained in it;) and he made them
prohibit the importation of opium, which had formerly been
permitted upon payment of duty; though, to this day, the traffic
is continued by them in full vigour at the outer anchorages, and
in the Typa near Macao, although it is prohibited to be landed
at the town, under the eye of the authorities. Nevertheless, a
sufficient quantity of it is brought into the town for local consumption.</p>

<p>Lin now appeared to have reached the pinnacle of his power.
He flattered himself that his schemes had been all successful;
his power appeared irresistible, because no effectual opposition
to it had yet been offered. The more concessions were made to
him, the more exacting he became; and having got the English
out of Macao, and made the Portuguese submissive to his will,
he then assumed a very bland and condescending tone.</p>

<p>In the interim, it was very evident that a storm of a new kind
was brewing, which was likely soon to burst upon his head.
Moreover, all the attempts he had made to control his own
people failed; his executions, his denunciations, and his
moral lectures, were alike unavailing. He gave the people a
year, within which they were to break off the habit by degrees,
and to reform their manners; and, at the end of that time, he
vowed he would execute every man amongst them that persisted
in it. In the meantime, he hit upon the last and darling expedient
of every Chinese statesman and philosopher, that of making
men mutually responsible for each other. Thus the whole people
were to be divided into tens, as they were elsewhere in the days
of Alfred the Great, and each one of the party was to be made
personally responsible for the good behaviour of all the rest with
whom he was associated.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these strong measures, urged with all the
sincerity of an enthusiast, they both failed at the time, and have
failed ever since to eradicate the evil. The demand for the drug
increased with the difficulty of procuring it; the indulgence became
dearer owing to the danger which attended it; and, after
all that was said and done, opium continued to be sought and
enormously paid for. It was more generally used than ever;
and even attention became directed to the cultivation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
poppy on Chinese soil, when the difficulty of procuring it from
abroad became more urgent.</p>

<p>Lin rose into high favour, for a time, with the Imperial court,
as might naturally be expected, and he was appointed governor
of the second province in the empire. But long before the time
came for him to remove to his new post, his star began to wane,
his difficulties increased, and ultimately his fall was as great as
his rise had been rapid.</p>

<p>For several months, as I have before stated, no British ship of
war was present in the Chinese waters. It was in this interval&mdash;namely,
in the month of July, 1839&mdash;that the great difficulty
arose which excited so much attention at the time, and has done
so since, arising out of the death of a Chinaman, by name Lin
Wiehe, at Hong-Kong, during an affray with some British
merchant seamen. This event was eagerly taken advantage of
by the commissioner to attempt to enforce certain claims against
the foreigners. Without entering into tedious details, many of
which are already well known, it will suffice to mention that the
man's death was really occasioned by a drunken row at a village
near Hong-Kong; that the commissioner, in accordance with what
had formerly been done on a similar occasion at Canton, demanded
the surrender of the <i>murderer</i> to be tried by Chinese
judges, and that Captain Elliot denied the jurisdiction altogether;
but, at the same time, he himself preferred an indictment for
murder against a seaman before a British grand-jury at Hong-Kong,
who ignored the bill. But several men were ultimately
found guilty of an assault only, and it appeared that one party
was just as much to blame as the other.</p>

<p>The commissioner then grew more angry than ever: he
caused the few English who still remained at Macao to be still
further persecuted, and it was only through the friendly assistance
of individual Portuguese families that they were enabled to
obtain their daily food. The result was, that the whole British
community left the place, together with Captain Elliot, and went
to live on board the different merchant ships in harbour.</p>

<p>Things could not remain long in such a state of embarrassment;
and, fortunately, on the 11th of September&mdash;that is,
about three months and a half after the Larne had left those
seas&mdash;the Volage, under Captain Smith, arrived. That gallant
officer immediately perceived that active steps of some kind must
be taken, and he accordingly issued a notice of blockade of the
port of Canton, upon the ground "that the regular supplies of
food had been prohibited to her Majesty's subjects; that the
Chinese people had been ordered to fire upon and seize them
wherever they went; and that certain of her Majesty's subjects
had been actually cut off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The immediate effect of this notice was to bring the Chinese,
in some measure, to their senses; their proclamations against
Englishmen were withdrawn&mdash;provisions were no longer prohibited;
and, consequently, Captain Smith very properly withdrew
his notice of blockade. Negotiations were entered into,
and it was at length agreed that trade should be resumed <i>outside</i>
the port of Canton.</p>

<p>Yet, all on a sudden, even this arrangement was violated by
the Chinese; and, on the 26th October, notice was issued that
they now required that ships should enter <i>within</i> the port of
Canton&mdash;that is, within the Bocca Tigris. They repeated the
demand for the murderer of Lin Wiehe to be given up,
and that a bond should be signed by all, agreeing to be tried
by <i>Chinese officers for offences declared by them, before trial, to
be capital</i>. If this mandate were not obeyed, the whole of the
foreign ships were to depart within three days, under a threat of
immediate destruction.</p>

<p>The whole fleet, therefore, was now recommended to anchor in
Tongkoo Bay, or Urmston's Harbour, which afterwards became
the rendezvous of all the ships of war.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter into minute details; it will be
sufficient for the full understanding of the future operations to
state that difficulties continued to increase on both sides, without
much prospect of any solution. The Hyacinth having now
arrived and joined the Volage on the 29th October, these two
vessels proceeded with Captain Elliot to Chuenpee, some
distance below the Bogue, to endeavour to obtain from the commissioner
some explicit declaration of his intentions. On the
3rd of November they were attacked by the Chinese admiral
with twenty-nine sail of war-junks, which, of course, they soon
beat off: and thus occurred the first direct hostile encounter
between the armed forces of the two nations. War now became
more than ever inevitable. Yet, at the end of the following
month, these two ships of war were again compelled to proceed
to the Bogue, in consequence of the seizure of a British subject
by the Chinese (not engaged in selling opium) at the anchorage
of Tongkoo Bay.</p>

<p>The blockade of the river and port of Canton was therefore
renewed by Captain Smith on the 15th January, 1840; but the
gentleman who had been seized, Mr. Gribble, was at once
restored, and the blockade was consequently raised.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this taken place, when down came to Macao a
new Chinese governor of that district, and issued a positive
edict for the immediate expulsion of all the English. Captain
Smith, with becoming spirit, instantly ordered the Hyacinth,
Captain Warren, to proceed into the inner harbour for the protection
of his countrymen, which measure seemed to give great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
umbrage to the Portuguese governor, Da Silveira Pinto; and,
in consequence of his representations, she was withdrawn on the
following morning.</p>

<p>Occasion was taken to make as much as possible out of this
occurrence, as if the Portuguese really possessed some authority
in the place beyond that over their own countrymen, and very
futile appeals were made to treaties with the Chinese government.
After all, the utmost that could be said of it was, that if
it was a little deficient in courtesy towards the Portuguese
governor, the latter should have rather volunteered his consent
to it. Nevertheless, the energetic spirit which it evinced undoubtedly
tended to check the presumption of the Chinese
authorities, and thus far to give some little security to British
subjects. Captain Smith very properly put it upon the ground
of its strengthening the Portuguese governor's hands, which in
reality it did, and which that functionary stood greatly in need
of. At the same time, Captain Smith very laudably expressed a
hope that the language in which his Excellency would "demand
the immediate removal of the Chinese forces, <i>declaredly</i> sent
here to seize or destroy my countrymen, (to the deep insult of
the Portuguese crown,) will be not less stringent, and as successful
in its operation, as that in which your Excellency has been
pleased to order the withdrawal of the Hyacinth."</p>

<p>During the whole of this time, preparations were being made
by the Chinese for future operations in the Canton River; fireships
were prepared, guns collected, and troops exercised.</p>

<p>On the 24th March, 1840, the fine frigate the Druid, commanded
by Lord John Churchill, arrived off Macao, and thence
proceeded to Tongkoo Roads, a most welcome reinforcement.
About this time, also, the Chinese purchased the English merchant
ship the Cambridge, intending to turn her into a man-of-war,
and built some strange-looking little schooners upon a
European model, with the view of employing them in some novel
way or other against the British ships.</p>

<p>It is said that, at one time, Commissioner Lin got up a sort of
sham fight at the Bogue, and dressed some of the assailants in red
clothes, in order to habituate the defenders to the sight of the
colour of the enemy's costume. Of course the red gentlemen were
thoroughly beaten. Matters had now proceeded so far, that it was
impossible that any solution of the enigma could be arrived at
without speedy employment of force. The success of their first
measures, and the helpless condition in which foreigners then
found themselves, had emboldened the Chinese beyond reason,
and had fed their presumption even till it burst with its own
self-applause.</p>

<p>Lord John Churchill, who was now, of course, senior officer,
unhappily died, after a few weeks' illness, on the 3rd of June.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Few days had elapsed before the Chinese sent a number of fireships
to endeavour to destroy the English merchant-ships collected
at the anchorage of Capsingmoon, but they proved a complete
failure.</p>

<p>The British naval force now rapidly gained accession to its
strength. The tidings of the events at Canton had spread to all
parts of the world. Preparations had been immediately commenced
in England and elsewhere for the coming contest. The
Alligator, from New South Wales, under Sir Gordon Bremer,
arrived about this time, as also did the Honourable Company's
steamer, Madagascar, and likewise the Wellesley, 74, in which
Sir Gordon Bremer hoisted his broad pendant; and, on the
28th of June, 1840, Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer established
a blockade of the port and river of Canton and all its entrances,
by command of her Majesty's government. Ships of war now
continued to arrive as fast as possible; the force in the Chinese
waters was considerable; and, within two or three days after the
commencement of the blockade, the chief command was assumed
by Rear-Admiral the Honourable George Elliot, who had just
arrived in the Melville, 74.</p>

<p>It will be generally admitted by all who have seen the Canton
river, or, as the Chinese call it, Choo-keang, that, in point of size,
depth, and picturesque character, it is one of the finest navigable
rivers in the world. Merchant ships of the largest size, perhaps
the proudest which float, have navigated it for nearly two
hundred years, to within a distance of nine or ten miles from
Canton, with little difficulty, and very inconsiderable danger.
No foreign commerce with any one port has been so valuable, so
extensive, or carried on with so much facility. The difficulties
of our intercourse, which have arisen within the last few years,
have formed an epoch in the world's history, and stand forth as
a leading beacon in the stream of time, pointing towards greater
eras yet to come.</p>

<p>An archipelago of numerous islands, most of them rocky, and
only partially productive, warns you of the approach to this
celebrated river. Strictly speaking, only that portion of it above
the Bocca Tigris has been called the river; while all below that
point, even from beyond Macao upwards, (the latter lying at the
distance of from forty to fifty miles from the Bogue forts,) has
been called the outer waters; nevertheless, it ought properly to
be included within the precincts of the river itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the questions connected with the opium-trade have been
brought so prominently forward, it has been maintained by some,
that the "outer waters" ought not properly to be considered
within Chinese jurisdiction. But this position would hardly
seem to be tenable; and there can be no sound reason for maintaining
that these waters should not be considered as much, and
<i>even more</i>, within their jurisdiction as the sea-coast or river
islands of any part of Europe are within the jurisdiction of the
country to which they belong, to the distance of a certain
number of miles from the land itself. In reality, the little
peninsula of Macao on the west, and the island of Lintao (not
to be confounded with Lintin) on the east, may be considered as
the proper boundaries of the entrance to the Canton River.</p>

<p>These points are about fifteen to twenty miles apart, while
between them lie several small islands, through which are the
two principal navigable passages (the western and the Lintao
passages) into the river itself. But the island of Lintao, called
Tyho by the Chinese, is a long, narrow, mountainous piece of
land, broken up into numerous bays and projecting points,
stretching from south-west to north-east, separated at the latter
extremity from the mainland only about the distance of a mile.
The passage and anchorage between them is called Capsingmoon,
and is made use of occasionally even by large vessels, which pass
towards the river or across from Macao towards the island of
Hong-Kong, which lies off the mainland at about five or six
miles to the eastward of Lintao.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The anchorage of Tongkoo Bay, towards which the Nemesis
was to proceed to rejoin the fleet, and which is also known by
the name of Urmston's Harbour, from having been recommended
by Sir James Urmston, formerly President of the Company's
factory at Canton, is situated about six miles due north from
Lintao, between the little islands called Tongkoo and Sowchow,
near the mainland, as you proceed upwards within the outer
waters of the Canton River, along its eastern shores. It was
here that the fleet anchored in 1823, in consequence of some
discussions with the Chinese, arising out of the affair of the
Topaze frigate, which occurred in the preceding year.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>About five miles distant from Tongkoo Bay, more towards the
centre of the river, and a little to the northward, is the small
island of Lintin, terminating in a very remarkable, high, conical
peak, which is a guide to all vessels passing up or down. It
has become famous as a place of rendezvous for the opium
vessels, particularly within the last few years; and a merchant
brig, bearing its name, has been recently sold to the Chinese as
a man-of-war, though old and not very serviceable. This island
must not be confounded with that of Lintao, before alluded to,
and from which it is about eight or nine miles distant.</p>

<p>Having now got fairly into Tongkoo Bay with the fleet, and
feeling something of the interest and excitement which were
awakened in the breasts of all who were brought together in
such a place and at such a time, we will next proceed to recount
a few of the remarkable events of the year 1840, reserving the
description of the other parts of the river for those portions of
the narrative with which they are connected.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July, 1840, the British force assembled in
China had become considerable: comprising no less than three
line-of-battle ships, with a Rear-Admiral and a Commodore;
thirteen other ships of war, of different kinds, and a large troop-ship;
together with four armed steamers, belonging to the East
India Company. To these must be added twenty-seven transports,
having on board the 18th, 26th, and 49th regiments, a body of
Bengal volunteers, and a corps of Madras sappers and miners.
The marines and seamen were of course prepared to co-operate
on shore. This was undoubtedly a formidable force, especially
when we reflect that little more than a year had elapsed since
there was <i>no armed force whatever</i> in the Chinese waters, and the
flag of England had ceased to wave even upon the Factories.</p>

<p>The measures adopted by the Governor-general of India, when
once the crisis had arrived, were sufficiently energetic and decisive.
The consequences of the rupture were now easily foreseen; and
the interest which the state of our relations with China had
begun to awaken, both in England and in India, was daily becoming
more general.</p>

<p>On the first arrival of the large force mentioned below,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> it did
not appear to alarm Commissioner Lin, and his obsequious
satellite, Governor Tang, nearly so much as might have been
expected. On the contrary, Lin continued to organize means of
defence, to enlist soldiers, and to arm his forts. It was, moreover,
at this moment that he hit upon his notable expedient of
offering immense rewards for the destruction, in any manner
whatever, of British ships, either men-of-war or merchant
vessels, and also for the capture or slaughter of British officers.
But the reward for taking them alive was to be greater than for
killing them. There was also a reward for taking soldiers or
<i>merchants</i>, but only one-fifth of the sum if they were killed. A
reward was also to be given for the capture of <i>coloured people</i>,
soldiers, or servants, although its amount was not mentioned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>All this followed after the declaration of blockade by Sir
Gordon Bremer, and after a public complaint had been made
by Captain Elliot against Lin and Tang, for various treacherous
acts, such as attacking our vessels at night (merchant vessels),
poisoning the water, and preventing supplies of food from being
brought to the factories, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It was now very evident, that although no formal declaration
of war had been made on our part, it had become impossible
to avoid warlike operations on an extended scale, and at no
distant time.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Elliot had now been associated with Captain
Elliot in his diplomatic functions, and they were nominated
Joint-Plenipotentiaries for settling the matters in dispute with
the Emperor. That object appeared little likely to be attained
by wasting time in negotiations with irresponsible and overbearing
public officers at Canton; it was, therefore, wisely
resolved to take advantage of the best season of the year while it
still lasted, and to proceed northward with the bulk of the force,
in order to bring the emperor and his ministers to their senses,
by exciting alarm as near as possible to the imperial capital.
The Peiho river, therefore, which commands one of the great
channels of intercourse with the metropolis, and is connected
with the Grand Canal, through which all the wealth of China
flows to Pekin, was now avowedly the chief point to which the
expedition was to be directed.</p>

<p>This movement was by no means a mere demonstration for
the purpose of giving éclat to the conduct of the negotiations,
but was in reality a <i>hostile</i> operation; at all events, it became so
as it proceeded, and the results of it may, in reality, be called
the First Campaign in China. It was commonly called the first
"China Expedition;" but the appellation was afterwards changed
to the "Eastern Expeditionary force," which was also applied to
the second expedition, as will be afterwards seen.</p>

<p>A small force being left at the Bogue to maintain the blockade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the bulk of the expedition, together with the two plenipotentiaries,
sailed to the northward at the end of June; part of the
force above mentioned did not arrive until after the rest had
sailed, but it soon followed the rest.</p>

<p>The first encounter with the Chinese took place at Amoy, in
the beginning of July, 1840. The Blonde, forty-four, Captain
Bourchier, was sent into the harbour of Amoy, to endeavour to
hand over a letter from the English naval commander-in-chief,
addressed to the "Admiral of the Chinese nation." This high
officer was not there, and the local mandarins refused to receive
it, and fired upon a boat which was sent to the beach bearing a
flag of truce at the bow, and conveying Mr. Thom, as interpreter,
for the purpose of delivering the letter to the mandarins, for
transmission to the Chinese admiral. The officers and crew of
the boat had a narrow escape, for, besides being received with
every possible indignity, the boat was fired at and <i>struck</i>, while
preparations were evidently being made for an attack upon the
frigate itself. Indeed, nothing could possibly be more hostile
and insulting than the conduct of the Chinese officers, who met
Mr. Thom at the landing-place. They shewed some inclination
even to seize the boat in which he came, and declared they
neither feared him nor the ship either.</p>

<p>The result of their hostile bearing and of the attack on the
boat was, that the guns of the Blonde were directed with terrific
effect upon the Chinese batteries and the war-junks, immediately
the boat reached the frigate. By this fire great damage was
done, and the Chinese troops, who had assembled on the beach,
were dispersed in all directions. Having inflicted this merited
chastisement, as an example to the Chinese, the Blonde again
set sail to join the main body of the force, in order to report the
circumstances to the admiral.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July, the town of Tinghai, the capital of the
island of Chusan, the principal of the group of islands bearing
that name, fell to her Majesty's arms after a very slight resistance.
But as this and other operations to the northward, during this
brief season, have been well described by Lord Jocelyn, it will be
sufficient merely to allude to them in a cursory way, particularly
as they were of minor importance compared with subsequent
events.</p>

<p>The failure of the attempt to deliver a letter from Lord Palmerston
to some of the authorities at Ningpo, to be transmitted to
the cabinet at Pekin, became a matter of serious importance,
after what had taken place at Amoy, and, in consequence, a
blockade of the coast was established from Ningpo to the mouth
of the Yangtze River, the most frequented and most commercial
part of the whole sea-board of China.</p>

<p>Nothing was more likely to make a deep impression upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Chinese government than the stoppage of this valuable trade,
upon which the daily sustenance of a large part of the population
of the interior actually depended. The ultimate conclusion of
peace, which was brought about by the more active prosecution
of these very measures, will be sufficient to prove their wisdom
at that time; and it is due to Captain Elliot to mention, that the
blockade of the Yangtze River was at all times one of his most
favourite projects.</p>

<p>About the middle of August, the bulk of the squadron arrived
off the mouth of the Peiho, below Tientsin, having been preceded
two or three days by Captain Elliot, on board the Madagascar
steamer.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Lord Palmerston's communication was there at length
received, by an officer deputed for that purpose by Keshen, the
governor of the province, and was forwarded to the emperor.
Subsequently, a conference was held on shore between Keshen
and Captain Elliot; and, whatever the results may otherwise
have been, it is well known that the plenipotentiaries were persuaded,
by the ingenuity of Keshen, that the future negotiations
could be conducted with more satisfaction at Canton (provided
a new commissioner were sent down from Pekin for that express
purpose) than within a hundred miles of the emperor's palace.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, while an answer was expected
from the emperor to the communication addressed to his ministers
by Lord Palmerston, the principal part of the squadron, which
had come up to the Peiho, sailed further northward, up the gulf
of Petchelee, to the great wall of China, which has so long been
classed among the wonders of the world. The effect of the emperor's
answer, and of the negotiations with Keshen was, that
this squadron withdrew from the neighbourhood of the capital;
and Keshen himself was appointed Imperial Commissioner, to
proceed at once to Canton, to open negotiations with the plenipotentiaries.
He was to supersede Lin, whose course seemed
almost run, and who was ordered to Pekin in haste, to answer
for his conduct. Nevertheless, he was subsequently allowed to
remain as viceroy, or governor, at Canton, but never succeeded
in obtaining the higher government which had been previously
promised to him elsewhere, in the heyday of his favour.</p>

<p>By the end of September, the squadron had returned to Chusan
from the Peiho. A truce was about this time announced and
published at Chusan; and a common impression prevailed that
a general armistice had been concluded at Tientsin with Keshen,
pending the result of the negotiations to be carried on at Canton.
This, however, was soon found to be erroneous; for, in a letter
addressed to the merchants by Admiral Elliot, in Tongkoo Bay,
on the 26th of November, (the very day after the Nemesis had
reported her arrival to the admiral,) it was publicly declared that
"the truce had been only entered into with Elepoo, the governor-general
of that province [Che-keang], and did not extend further."
It must, however, have included the port of Ningpo, and other
parts of the coast of the mainland, within the limits of the
governor's authority.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>The plenipotentiaries, Captain Elliot and the Honourable
George Elliot, returned to Macao on the 20th of November. It
was on the following day that The Queen steamer was fired at
and hit, as she passed the Chuenpee fort with a flag of truce.
She had orders to proceed up to the Bogue, to deliver a letter
which had been entrusted to her captain from "Elepoo," (probably
concerning the truce he had concluded,) addressed to the
Imperial Commissioner Keshen at Canton. In return for this
attack, she threw a few shells and heavy shot into the fort, and
went back to Tongkoo Bay <i>re infectâ</i>. This was the second time
a flag of truce had been fired at, although the Chinese perfectly
understood the peaceful purpose which it denoted. The despatch,
however, was forwarded the same evening to Keshen at Canton,
through the sub-prefect of Macao, into whose hands it was delivered
by Captain Elliot. It was also reported that the commandant
at Chuenpee sent up some of The Queen's heavy shot,
which had lodged in the fort, as a present to the authorities at
Canton, probably to shew how brave he had been to withstand
such weighty missiles. He did not lose the opportunity to claim
a victory for having <i>driven</i> her off!</p>

<p>A heavy force was by this time collected at the mouth of the
Canton River, reinforced as it had been by the arrival of the
Calliope and Samarang, and also of the Nemesis, and by the
addition of a fresh regiment, the 37th Madras native infantry.</p>

<p>Keshen arrived at Canton on the 29th of November, and
sent an official notification to that effect to the plenipotentiaries;
and it is remarkable that, almost at the same moment, Admiral
Elliot was compelled to resign the command of the fleet, and
also his duties as joint-plenipotentiary, through sudden and
severe illness. A few days afterwards he embarked for England
in the Volage, leaving Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer as commander-in-chief,
and Captain Elliot for the time as again the
sole plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>In order to render complete the general sketch of passing
events to the close of 1840, I must not omit to mention the
gallant affair at Macao under Captain Smith, commanding the
Druid, which happened in the month of August, at the period
when the main body of the expedition was engaged in the operations
to the northward, already alluded to. It will be remembered
that Captain Smith had once before thought it necessary
to sail into the Inner Harbour, for the protection of British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
subjects, but had retired upon a representation being made to
him by the Portuguese government.</p>

<p>In the month of August, however, strange rumours of a rather
threatening character began to prevail, but not of a very definite
kind. One of the principal Chinese officers of Macao had been
absent for some time at Canton, and, on his return, accompanied,
or rather followed, by a body of troops, it became very evident
that some hostile measure was in contemplation. A number of
war-junks were likewise collected in the Inner Harbour, having
troops on board. A considerable body of men were also encamped
upon the narrow neck of land which separates Macao
from the mainland, and across which there is a so-called Barrier,
which forms the line of demarcation, beyond which the Portuguese
have no jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This Barrier is composed of a wall, with parapets and a ditch
running across the isthmus, and having a gateway, with a guard-house
over it, in the centre. Beyond the Barrier the Chinese
had very recently thrown up a flanking field-work, mounting
about twelve guns, with a view of protecting the rear of the
Barrier from the attack of an enemy attempting to land in boats.
The war-junks were also placed so close in shore, in the Inner
Harbour, as to be able to protect the Barrier on that side.</p>

<p>These movements were quite sufficient to prove that some
attack was actually contemplated upon Macao itself, and the
result of it, if successful, cannot be thought of without horror.
But the promptitude and energy of Captain Smith anticipated
the designs of the Chinese, and, by a most decisive and admirably
combined movement, he soon scattered the whole Chinese forces
like chaff before the wind. Taking with him the Larne and
Hyacinth, with the Enterprise steamer and the Louisa cutter, he
sailed boldly up towards the Barrier, and ran in as close as the
shallowness of the water would permit. He then opened a
spirited fire upon the whole of the Chinese works and barracks,
which the Chinese returned. Their soldiers were seen mustering
from different points, for the defence of the position.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour, the firing of the Chinese was almost
silenced, and then a single gun was landed upon the beach,
which raked the Chinese position, while a small body of marines,
under Lieutenant Maxwell, with some small-arm men from the
Druid, under Lieutenant Goldsmith, and about two companies of
Bengal volunteers, under Captain Mee, altogether about three
hundred and eighty men, landed, and drove the Chinese, with
considerable loss, from every one of their positions. On the
British side, four men only were wounded. The Chinese guns
were spiked, but none were carried away, and the whole of their
troops were dispersed, nor did they afterwards approach the
Barrier, except to carry off the spiked guns. The barracks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
other buildings were burned; and all our men having re-embarked
late in the evening, the vessels returned to their former
anchorage in Macao roads.</p>

<p>Seldom has a more signal service been rendered in so short a
space of time, than this well-timed and energetic measure adopted
by Captain Smith.</p>

<p>There still remain one or two points worth noticing, in order
to complete the series of events which happened in the year
1840. Among these, one of the most important was the issuing
of an Order in Council, for the establishment of courts of admiralty
in China, for the adjudication of prizes, &amp;c. It was to the
effect that, "in consideration of the <i>late injurious proceedings</i> of
certain officers of the Emperor of China towards certain of our
officers and subjects, and, whereas, orders had been given that
satisfaction and reparation for the same should be demanded
from the Chinese government, it was necessary, for the purpose
of enforcing those orders, that all vessels and goods belonging
to the Emperor of China or <i>his subjects</i> should be detained and
brought into port; and that, in the event of reparation and
satisfaction being refused by the Chinese government, a court of
admiralty should be formed for the purpose of adjudging and
condemning them as prizes."</p>

<p>This order in council was not acted upon, except on a very
limited scale, and for a very brief period. It was afterwards
considered more equitable that the burden of the war should be
made to fall as much as possible upon the <i>government</i> of China,
and as little as possible upon the people; and this highly judicious
and humane determination was carried out as much as
possible, and with the best results, during all the latter part of
the war, much to the credit of all concerned.</p>

<p>During the year 1840, very little progress was made in our
endeavours to gain over the Chinese people to our interests, or
to conciliate their forbearance, in any of the places in which we
were brought into contact with them. At Chusan, in particular,
they evinced the most hostile spirit towards us, and lost no
opportunity of exhibiting their hatred of the foreigner. It was
not without great difficulty even that provisions could be obtained
for our men; there was evidently some secret influence which
operated to prevent the people from meeting us amicably, and
made them, for some time, resist even the temptation of gain, so
difficult for a Chinaman to withstand. Nothing tended to exhibit
their hostile spirit so much as their persevering attempts
to carry off our men by stealth, whenever they could find an
opportunity; and indeed the kidnapping system was followed
up with many circumstances of barbarity, to the very close of the
war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>This embittered our men very much against the Chinese, and
we may almost wonder that their prisoners, when they fell into our
hands, received such lenient treatment in return. The story is well
known of Captain Anstruther's capture at Chusan, at the distance
of only two or three miles from the town, his being tied up in a
sack, and subsequently carried over in a boat to Ningpo on the
mainland, and the curious history of his confinement in a
bamboo cage, three feet long by two feet broad; and other
instances of a similar kind, in which the prisoners were treated
with the utmost barbarity, have been so often recounted, that a
passing allusion to them will here be sufficient. Captain Anstruther,
however, would seem to have been more leniently
treated than many of the other prisoners: and I have heard him
declare that, with respect to the better class of mandarins at
Ningpo, he had little cause of complaint to urge against them,
considering that he was a <i>prisoner</i> in an enemy's hands. His
talent for drawing, however, enabled him to conciliate their good
will, and to earn for himself some indulgences which others were
not fortunate enough to procure. He sold his drawings and
particularly his portraits, for a tolerable price. Many of the
other prisoners, however, were treated with frightful barbarity,
and, in some instances, they were put to death.</p>

<p>A much more formidable enemy to us than the Chinese was
soon discovered, in the terrible sickness which broke out among
our troops at Chusan, and carried off many a brave man prematurely
to his grave. The low, swampy rice-grounds surrounding
the town, the want of proper drainage, the exposure to the hot
sun, and the use of the deleterious spirit which the Chinese call
samshoo, made from rice, (of which a vast quantity was manufactured
on the island for exportation,) all these causes combined
sufficed to produce fever, dysentery, and various complaints,
which committed great havoc among the men. The island was
subsequently, however, rendered less unhealthy by better arrangements,
and by enforcing greater cleanliness.</p>

<p>At Amoy, after the affair of the Blonde, a strict blockade was
maintained by the Alligator and other vessels, which interrupted
the whole trade of that important commercial city. But none of
our ships astonished and alarmed the Chinese so much as the
steamers; they were particularly alluded to in the official reports
to the emperor, and were described as "having wheels at their
sides, which, revolving, propelled them like the wind, enabling
them to pass to and fro with great rapidity, acting as leaders;"
and it is not surprising that the Chinese should soon have
christened them the "Demon Ships."</p>

<p>The effect of our operations to the northward had already been
to excite great alarm in the mind of the emperor and of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ministers; indeed the panic created by the first approach of a hostile
force was so great, that a very small body of men might have
marched almost from one end of China to the other, so little were
the Chinese prepared for resistance. But gradually they recovered
their energy, improved their means of defence, adopted
better weapons, and cast heavier guns. As far as personal
bravery could aid them, they were by no means an enemy to be
despised. The spear and the bayonet frequently crossed each
other; perhaps more frequently than the bayonets of Europeans do;
and, in not a few instances, the <i>long</i> spear was more than a match
for the shorter bayonet. Hand to hand encounters with the
Tartar troops were not uncommon towards the close of the war;
and, indeed, many of our men learnt, to their cost, that they had
held the Chinese far too cheap. Instances occurred in which
the powerful Tartar soldier rushed within the bayonet-guard of
his opponent, and grappled with him for life or death.</p>

<p>We may now revert to the period of the arrival of the new
Imperial Commissioner Keshen at Canton, with a view to treat
with the plenipotentiaries, according to the terms agreed upon
at the Pehio, as before mentioned. His predecessor, Lin, whose
fall had now commenced, could not resist giving a parting warning
to the people, against the continuance of their pernicious
habits; and he even assured them that, if they still persisted,
"they would assuredly, one and all of them, be strangled."</p>

<p>In the beginning of December the greater part of our naval
forces had again assembled below the Bogue, although a squadron
was still left to the northward. Notwithstanding that Keshen
had arrived for the ostensible purpose of inquiring into and
settling all matters in dispute, it was evident that the Chinese
were making hostile preparations, with a view to a very different
mode of settlement of the question. A feeling of uncertainty
and apprehension prevailed, such as generally precedes some
great movement. The Chinese, on their side, were collecting
troops, and raising new works; while, on our side, every precaution
was taken, in case a resumption of hostilities should be
called for.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the Nemesis, which had been for some days at
anchor with the fleet, a few miles below Chuenpee, conveyed
Captain Elliot down to Macao, while the rest of the fleet moved
nearer up towards the Bogue, as if with the object of supporting
the "negotiations" by a firm display of power. Captain Elliot's
stay at Macao was very short, and from the increased activity of
our preparations at the Bogue, it became evident that the "negotiations"
were not going on satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Numerous communications were passing between Macao and
our fleet at the Bogue; Captain Elliot himself went backwards
and forwards several times in the Nemesis, and the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
seemed fast approaching when some very decided blow was to be
struck.</p>

<p>The following description of the scene of operations will therefore
be found interesting. About twenty-two to twenty-five miles
above the island of Lintin, before described, and consequently
about the same distance above Tongkoo Bay, on the same side
of the river, is a projecting headland, about a mile and a quarter
wide, distinguished at a considerable distance by the high peak
in which its summit terminates. On either side of it there is a
fine sandy beach, off which there is a good anchorage. This is
Chuenpee.</p>

<p>The hill, which is its principal feature, stands rather towards
the northern side of the promontory, and is divided into two
conical eminences, upon one of which there was a high building,
resembling a watch tower, which was now fortified, and formed a
conspicuous object as you ascend the river. At the bottom of
the hill there were a considerable stone battery and other works.
The whole of these had been very recently strengthened and extended.
A line of entrenchment, with mud batteries, had also
been carried round the rear. Behind the hill also, in an opening
looking towards the north, or into Anson's Bay, another
small battery had been erected, with an enclosed space or square
for barracks, surrounded by a parapet wall.</p>

<p>The extent of these works was not properly known, until the
attack upon the place had commenced. It was generally believed
that the promontory and hill of Chuenpee were connected with
the mainland, and it was not until some time after the place was
taken that the discovery was made, as will presently be described,
that Chuenpee was, in reality, <i>an island</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>On the opposite or western side of the river, which is here
about three miles wide, is another smaller promontory, called
Tycocktow, with a line of strong batteries close along the shore,
faced with granite: This was also subsequently found to be an
<i>island</i>. The whole of the country which borders the river is
mountainous and picturesque.</p>

<p>Returning again to the east side, about four to five miles above
Chuenpee, we come to the high hill and fortifications of Anunghoy,
the most important of the works at the Bogue. Between
Chuenpee and Anunghoy lies the beautiful bay called Anson's
Bay, about two miles deep; on one side of which it was at one
time proposed to found an English town. Anunghoy, like
Chuenpee, was discovered to be also an <i>island</i>; and that circumstance,
as will be afterwards seen, was a source of great
anxiety to Keshen, who saw the consequent weakness of the
position of Anunghoy, and reported it to the emperor. In fact,
our light squadron might have probably gone up the river by
the passage at the back of Anunghoy, without passing through
the Bogue at all. But these facts were not then known.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>The works at Anunghoy consisted of two very strong, heavy
batteries, built of excellent granite, and partly of the composition
called chunam. The masses of stone were afterwards found to
be of immense size, so much so, that it was no easy task to blow
the works to pieces, even after they were taken. The two principal
batteries were connected together by temporary works of
recent construction; and according to the usual Chinese practice,
a semicircular wall was carried round the rear of each fort along
the side of the hill.</p>

<p>The breadth of the river from Anunghoy to the opposite side
is from two to three miles, being somewhat less than it is lower
down between Chuenpee and Tycocktow. But in the very middle
of the river in this part are two rocky islands, called North and
South Wantung, of moderate elevation, and also a smaller rock,
scarcely visible at high water. Hence there are two channels up
the river, one on either side of these islands, but that on the east
side towards Anunghoy is the one which had always been frequented
by foreign ships, and was considered to be the Bocca
Tigris, or Bogue.</p>

<p>The passage on the western side of Wantung was not only not
frequented by Europeans, but not even known to be navigable,
until our preparations were made for the capture of the Bogue
forts, when some of our ships passed up on that side to the
attack of North Wantung. The true Bogue, or eastern passage,
is only about three quarters of a mile wide; the current, or rather
the tide, is very rapid, on which account ships generally prefer
keeping rather near to the Anunghoy side. Of the two islands
called Wantung, the northern is the highest and largest, lying
quite opposite Anunghoy, and was very strongly fortified. South
Wantung, the smaller island, was not fortified by the Chinese,
being not considered by them of sufficient importance to require
it. It lies some distance lower down the river, and looking at
their relative positions, you would hardly suppose they were
within effectual gun-shot distance from each other. Such, however,
was the case; and the Chinese forts on North Wantung
were shelled from South Wantung by a small battery, constructed
by a detachment of our troops in a single night, being covered
during their work principally by the Nemesis, which ran close in
shore for that purpose, being herself sheltered by the island.</p>

<p>Further to obstruct the passage up the Bogue, the Chinese
had carried an immense chain, or rather a double chain, across
it, supported by large rafts from one side to the other, one end
of it being secured at Anunghoy, and the other end being
fastened into a rock near South Wantung, which was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
covered at high water. To complete the account of these
famous defences, it only remains to mention another fort on the
western side of the river, nearly opposite Wantung, which was
called Little Tycocktow, and was not of recent construction.
By the Chinese themselves, these extensive works were considered
impregnable, for they had not yet experienced the tremendous
effect of the concentrated fire of line-of-battle-ships.</p>

<p>Tiger Island can scarcely be said to form part of the Bocca
Tigris; it lies nearly two miles above Wantung; and, although
there was a considerable stone battery on its eastern side, it was
not likely to be of any service, and the Chinese wisely abandoned
it, and removed the guns. This island, however, is a remarkable
feature in the general aspect of the river, being in reality a high
rocky mountain, cleft in two at the top, and presenting to view
several deep chasms on both sides, yet clothed with verdure in
some parts, while it is rudely broken up in others. It is
altogether a very peculiar object, although it cannot be said to
bear much resemblance to a tiger's head, from which it takes its
name.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>The Imperial Commissioner Keshen now wisely resolved to
gain as much time as he could by negotiation; and seemed in
the first instance to have almost equalled his predecessor Lin,
in his desire "to control the foreigners, and to reduce them to
submission." His conferences with that functionary, who now
remained at Canton as viceroy, were numerous and confidential;
but, instead of precipitating the crisis by mad violence, he professed
to trust rather to the "employment of <i>truth</i> and the
<i>utmost reason</i>" to attain his ends.</p>

<p>Keshen's cautiousness was at once shewn by the instructions
which he issued respecting the nature of the <i>white flag</i>, and by
his enjoining that for the future the troops were "not rashly to
open their artillery, without <i>first</i> ascertaining what was the purpose
of the approach of any boat bearing such a flag." And,
moreover, that "they were not to <i>provoke</i> hostilities, by being the
first to fire on the foreign ships, nor in their <i>desire for honours</i>
to endeavour to create trouble." On his side, likewise, Captain
Elliot was quite as anxious to avoid a collision as Keshen himself;
and thus affairs went on until the close of the year, without
any approach whatever to a solution of the difficulties. Keshen
exhibited a vast deal of tact and</p>

<div class="poem">
"&mdash;&mdash; <i>cunning</i>, which in fools supplies,<br />
And amply, too, the place of being wise."<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Great as our force already was even at that period, it does not
at all seem to have intimidated Keshen, who appeared to gain
courage as he gained time. Indeed, it could hardly be expected
that the ancient barrier of Chinese pride and self-sufficiency
would crumble down before a single blow, however strong; and
even the chief actor in the scene himself hesitated long to strike,
when he knew that it would make an empire tremble.</p>

<p>But the great, the haughty, the mysterious China was at
length destined to open her portals to the resistless "barbarian."
Among the important personages who contributed indirectly to
bring about this wonderful result, perhaps not the least remarkable
was the Empress herself, to whom some allusion has already
been made. Very little was heard concerning her at the time,
in remote parts of the world, and therefore a few additional
notices must be interesting. She must, indeed, have been a person
of no ordinary character, who could have raised herself, by
her talents and her fascinations, to a seat upon the throne of the
Emperor of China. Her early history is little recorded, but her
influence was secretly known and felt in almost every part of
the empire, even before she obtained the short-lived honours of
an empress.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine how any woman, brought up in the
subordinate position which is alone allotted to the sex in China,
with the imperfect education which is there attainable, and with
all the prejudices of her early life, and the proud assumption of
superiority of the other sex to contend against, could have had
imparted to her the peculiar tone of character which she possessed.
In her attempts to reform and to improve, she never ceased to
be <i>Chinese</i>; indeed, she seems to have thought that to <i>restore</i>
what was fallen to decay was the best kind of reform. She sought
the removal of abuse, the purification of public offices, and the
improvement of the details of administration throughout the
country. Her influence became paramount; and those who
could not be gained by her arguments are said to have been led
by her fascinations.</p>

<p>The words of the Emperor's public eulogy of the Empress, after
her death, will in a measure point out this feature in her character.
He declared that "she was overflowing of kindness to all, lovely
and winning." She held control over the hearts of those about
her, not by dint of authority, but by gentleness and forbearance.
"Her intercourse," he added, "lightened for me the burden
of government, and the charms she spread around conciliated all
hearts. And now I am alone and sad."</p>

<p>In her choice of persons for high employment, the Empress
possessed the most valuable of all talents to those who are called
upon to exercise their power of selection&mdash;that of distinguishing
not merely abstract merit, but of discerning those less conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
qualities of the mind which constitute <i>fitness</i> for office
and aptitude for public distinction.</p>

<p>The greatest influence of the Empress seems to have been
exercised about the years 1835 and 1836, and it was just at that
period that the question was so keenly debated, at court and elsewhere,
whether opium should be permitted, under certain modified
regulations, or whether it were possible to put an end to the
traffic by force, and to <i>drive the nation</i> from its use by fear. This
was evidently the commencement of a new era in that country,
for whatever might be the result of the debate upon this important
question in the Chinese cabinet, the effect of it was to occasion
the agitation of the subject throughout the empire. Agitation in
China!</p>

<p>But a spirit of change had now begun to tincture even the
minds of true Chinamen, and the amiable Empress herself became
affected by, and even in a measure encouraged, that movement.
The vice-president of the sacrificial board, by name Heu
Naetze, and others, amongst whom was reckoned also Keshen,
belonged to the immediate favourites of the Empress, and but
for that high protection it is probable that Heu Naetze would
hardly have ventured to present his famous memorial in favour
of the legalization of the opium-trade.</p>

<p>His chief and most important argument was, not that it would
be a good thing in itself, but that it would be perfectly impossible
to prevent it by any means the government could adopt; and
also that foreign trade generally was of importance to China,
from the revenue which it produced, and the employment which
it gave to the people. He shewed how totally ineffectual every
increase of punishment, even to death itself, had proved, for the
prevention of the practice, which, on the contrary, had increased
tenfold; and he then went on to make it evident that "when
opium was purchased secretly, it could only be exchanged with
silver; but that, if it were permitted to be bought openly, it would
be paid for in the productions of the country." And he cleverly
adds: "the dread of the laws is not so great among the people
as the <i>love of gain</i>, which unites them to all manner of crafty
devices, so that sometimes the law is rendered wholly ineffective."
But he would still prohibit all public officers, scholars, and
soldiers, from using it, under pain of instant dismissal from the
public service.</p>

<p>It is known that the Empress received this recommendation
with particular favour, but the Emperor referred it for the consideration
of the crafty old Tang, the Governor of Canton, who
was at the very time deriving a large revenue from winking at
the clandestine sale of the drug. The answer of Tang and his
colleagues was decidedly favourable to the project. They declared
that "<i>the circumstances of the times</i> rendered a change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
regulations necessary." They openly admitted that the payment
of distinct duties would be far less onerous than the payment
of <i>bribes</i>; that the laws could then be administered, and would
be <i>respected</i>; and that the precious metals which were now
oozing out of the empire would then be retained in it. They even
went so far as to say that the <i>dignity</i> of the government would
by no means be lowered by it; and they farther declared that
the prohibition of the luxury made it more eagerly sought for.</p>

<p>Here, then, was clearly another triumph on the Empress's side;
and those who were opposed to her principles feared it as such,
and redoubled their efforts to produce her fall. But the recommendation
did not even stop at that point; for it went so far as
even to encourage the cultivation and preparation of the poppy
within the empire, in order to exclude a portion of the foreign
article from the market.</p>

<p>One might have supposed that the influences which were now
at work to produce a better state of foreign trade, backed by the
countenance of the Empress, and supported by the apparent
neutrality of the Emperor, would have sufficed to occasion some
modification in the existing laws.</p>

<p>Keshen himself, who had what is called a long head, though
in good favour with the Empress, and influential in the country,
seems to have remained at that time neutral upon the question
in agitation. Others, however, shewed a bitter hostility to every
change, but bitterest of all to the whole race of foreigners.
When they could no longer argue with success against the
principles of what might be called the free-trade party, they
raked up all the smouldering ashes of deadly hostility to
foreigners, because they were <i>not Chinese</i>, (however estimable
they might otherwise be,) and they appealed to an old saying of
the Emperor Kanghe, the grandfather of his present Majesty&mdash;namely,
"that there is cause for apprehension, lest, in
centuries to come, <i>China may be endangered by collision with the
various nations of the West, who come hither from beyond the
seas</i>." Indeed, it is well known that there prevailed in China a
tradition to that effect; and also another, "that China would be
conquered by a woman, in time to come." And so generally
were these two predictions or traditions remembered during the
war, that the impression came to prevail among many of the
people that it would be useless to resist us, because we were a
people from the far west, and were ruled by a queen.</p>

<p>The two principal memorials on the opposite side of the
question have been pretty generally circulated; one being by
Choo Tsun, a member of council and of the Board of Rites,
the other by Heu Kew, a censor of the military department.
They argued for the <i>dignity</i> of the empire, and the danger "of
<i>instability</i> in maintaining the laws." They called for increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
severity of the law itself, not only to <i>prevent</i> the exportation of
<i>silver</i>, but to arrest the <i>enervation</i> and destruction of the people,
and they openly declared their belief that the purpose of the
English was to weaken the people and to ruin the central land;
and they further appealed to all the "luminous admonitions" of
the emperors and others of olden days against the influence of
foreigners. Memorials also came in from many of the provinces,
particularly those along the coast, shewing that even the army
had become contaminated by opium, and that soldiers sent
against the rebels in recent seditions were found to have very
little strength left, though their numbers were large. In short,
the whole of the memorialists on the <i>anti-importation</i> side
argued to the effect that increased severity could stop the use of
opium, and therefore that it <i>ought</i> to be stopped, because it
tended to enervate the people, and make them an easy prey to
the foreigner, while the quantity of silver exported enriched the
latter in proportion as it impoverished the former. Thus the
hatred of opium and detestation of the foreigner became very
nearly synonymous.</p>

<p>At length, when the Emperor's beloved son died from the
effects of opium in the imperial palace, then the grief of the
Emperor, and the conviction of the misery produced by the drug,
worked upon his feelings fully as much as upon his judgment.
An attempt was made to place the question upon <i>moral</i> grounds;
and the Emperor affected on a sudden to weep for the misfortunes
of the nation, and to lament the depravity of his "dear
children;" and his paternal heart, in the exuberance of its
benignity, determined to cut off all their heads, if they would
not mend their ways. Thus, by degrees, the reformation of
morals became the subject of agitation quite as much as the
principles of trade had been before. By this time, the influence
of the Empress had quite declined. She forgot that in making
many friends she had made many influential enemies. Neither
her beauty nor her talents could save her, and she fell rapidly
from her pinnacle of power. She only lived to share the
Emperor's throne for about five or six years; a very short but
remarkable reign. She could not survive the loss of her power;
and when her opponents so completely recovered theirs, her
proud spirit sunk under the weight which pressed upon her.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more touching than the expressions of the
Emperor, published in the Pekin Gazette. He calls her a perfect
pattern of "filial piety;" and therefore bestows upon her the
posthumous title of the "perfectibility of filial obedience." It
should be here remarked, that what they call "filial piety" is the
highest moral attribute in the Chinese system of ethics.</p>

<p>The Empress died in the beginning of 1840, and was buried
with great pomp; the whole nation was ordered to go into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
mourning for a month, and the public officers were not to shave
their heads for one hundred days, as a mark of their sorrow.
Her death left the Emperor Taou-kwang surrounded by troubles
and dangers in his old age, with few about him whom he could
trust, and none to comfort him in his difficulties. She left two or
three young children. But he had six children by his former wife,
of whom nearly all, or, it is believed, more than half have died.</p>

<p>The Emperor was born on the 20th September, 1782, and is
therefore upwards of sixty-two years old. He ascended the
throne in 1820. The troubles and continual disturbances which
have marked his reign, the frequent rebellions and disorders
which have long been the constant theme of his animadversions
in the Pekin Gazette, may perhaps be considered less as the
result of his own measures than as the marking features of the
present era in Chinese history. He ascended the throne when
disorders were almost at their height, and when a conspiracy
had already broken out in his father's palace. Indeed, he was
expressly selected by his father to be his successor, (although not
the <i>eldest</i>, but the second son,) because he had on a former
occasion distinguished himself by his energy and success in
crushing a traitorous attempt within the palace.</p>

<p>The Emperor appears to be an amiable but weak man, well
intentioned towards his people, sensible of the difficulties of his
country, but, at the same time, blinded and misinformed by the
favourites about him, and retaining too many early prejudices to
be able thoroughly to cope with all the difficulties which have
from time to time beset him.</p>

<p>The next most important character who figured at the period
which has been already alluded to was Commissioner Lin, of
whom so much has been said. The principal features of his
character have been already delineated. He is described as
having been stout in person, with a vivacious but not unpleasant
manner, unless highly excited; with a keen, dark, penetrating
eye, which seemed to indicate that he could assume two opposite
characters, according as it might suit his interest or his ambition.
He had a clear, distinct voice, and is said to have rarely smiled.
His countenance indicated a mind habituated to care. In the
course of his proceedings at Canton, he seems never to have permitted
himself to adopt the character of a "negotiator," but invariably
to have assumed that of a "dictator," which was more natural
to him. His word was law. He was not dismayed by sudden difficulties,
and appears to have been quite sincere in all his wishes
to arrest the progress of the evils he complained of, and to reform
the morals of the people. With this object, he closed all the
gaming-houses at Canton, which were as numerous as the opium-shops,
or more so, and were generally maintained in conjunction
with the latter; so much do vices court each other's company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>In reality, Lin feared the foreigners as much as he hated
them. But the intercourse he now had with them led him to
value their knowledge more highly, and probably he knew full
well that knowledge is power. He had portions of English
works translated for his own use, such as Thelwall's pamphlet
against opium, Murray's geography, (parts,) &amp;c.; and he had
in his employ three or four young Chinamen, who knew something
of English, and of English habits, having visited the straits'
settlements, and one of them the United States.</p>

<p>Lin was by no means wanting in energy to meet the great
crisis which he had contributed so much to produce. In addition
to the enlisting of troops, the preparation of defences, the
casting of guns, building of fire-vessels and gun-boats, &amp;c., he
directed that many passages of the river should be blocked up
with stones, and others staked across with piles.</p>

<p>In short, Lin was a bold, uncompromising, and specious man.
He tried to console the Emperor, by assuring him that he was
quite certain that, along the northern coast, sickness and cold
would carry off all the barbarian forces, even if the want of food,
and the exhaustion of their powder and shot, did not reduce
them to extremities; but he never once alluded to any probability
of being able to beat off the barbarians in fair fight.</p>

<p>With regard to his successor, Keshen, his character will be
better developed as we proceed. But it is worth while here to
remark, that Keshen appears to have been one of the few about
the court who began to apprehend serious consequences from Lin's
measures. He had always been cautious in committing himself,
and though no friend of the foreigners, he had feared their power,
and felt the weakness of his own country, as well as the necessity
of trying some other measures than those means hitherto employed,
to put a stop to the perpetual disturbances which took
place in several parts of the empire, and threatened rebellion
even within the capital.</p>

<p>Keshen was an astute courtier, a polished and well-mannered
man, and all those who were present at either of his two interviews
with Captain Elliot were struck with his courteous and
gentlemanlike manner. Although he made every preparation
for resistance, he seems to have thought he could gain more by
diplomacy, and he resolved to take advantage of the disposition
for negotiation rather than dictation on Captain Elliot's part,
to play his cards with tact and cunning, in the hope of gaining
time. But he saw his weakness, and the impossibility of contending
with success against our forces, and, having distinctly
reported thereon to the Emperor, he was, of course, set down as
a coward, and, consequently, as a traitor. He had the boldness
to tell the Emperor the actual weakness of his strongest points
of defence; whereas, Lin only stated how much stronger they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<i>would</i> have been, had the government made it a rule to have
devoted ten per cent. of the whole customs' revenue of Canton
to the improvement of their means of defence, the building of
ships, and the casting of cannon.</p>

<p>In one thing, however, Lin and Keshen were both of a mind&mdash;namely,
as to the importance of the foreign trade of Canton to
the imperial revenue. They ventured to correct the Emperor's
notion that the customs' duties of Canton were "unimportant,
and not worth a thought," by telling him that they "already"
produced upwards of thirty millions of taels, or ten millions
sterling, and that, as the revenue of Canton far <i>exceeded</i> that of
any other province, a portion of this considerable sum, which
was obtained <i>from</i> foreigners, should have been applied to defending
themselves against <i>foreigners</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Much has at various times been said about Keshen's treachery
and bad faith. But it will be seen, as we proceed, that he was
driven into these acts by the distinct orders of the Emperor, and
that keeping faith with <i>us</i> was to be viewed as treachery to his
master. Indeed, the severity of Keshen's punishment at the
Emperor's hands proves not so much how ill he served his master,
as how unfortunate he was in having a much more profound
head than Lin, in being able to see farther into futurity, and to
catch the shadows of coming events; in short, how much too far
in advance of his countrymen he was, in being able to appreciate
their position in the face of the foreigner, and how unfortunate
in <i>presuming</i> to attempt to ward off the dreaded blow by timely
concession.</p>

<p>Without anticipating further the remarkable points in Keshen's
career, which will be better developed as we proceed, we may
now turn our attention to the interesting events of the year 1841.</p>

<p>We have already seen that there was little probability, at the
close of 1840, of any satisfactory arrangement being made between
Keshen and Captain Elliot without a resort to arms. Accordingly,
all preparations were completed; and, the first week in
January having passed without any nearer prospect of a settlement,
although repeated opportunities had been given to Keshen
to arrange matters amicably, as had been proposed at the conference
at Tientsin, orders were at length issued for the immediate
resumption of hostilities. The morning of the 7th of
January, 1841, was the period fixed on for the attack upon the
forts at Chuenpee and Tycocktow, being the lowest, or, in other
words, the first, you approach in ascending the river. The
object was to reduce the whole of the famous defences of the
Bogue one after the other, and, if necessary, to destroy them.</p>

<p>The plan of attack upon Chuenpee, and the forts on the opposite
side of the river at Tycocktow, was as follows, under the
direction of Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer, who, it will be
remembered, had become commander-in-chief upon the retirement
of Rear-Admiral the Honourable George Elliot, in consequence
of severe illness. The troops, comprising detachments
of the 26th and 49th regiments, (the greater part of which were
with their head-quarters at Chusan,) under Major Johnstone, of
the 26th, together with the whole of the 37th Madras Native
Infantry, under Captain Duff, of that regiment, and a detachment
of the Bengal Volunteers, under Captain Bolton, were to embark
on board the Enterprise and Madagascar steamers by eight
o'clock in the morning, to be conveyed to the point of debarkation,
which was selected about two miles and a half below
Chuenpee, to the southward, where they were to be landed in
boats. The Nemesis took on board a large portion of the 37th.
A battalion of royal marines, upwards of five hundred strong,
under Captain Ellis, were to be landed in the boats of their respective
ships; while a body of seamen, under Lieutenant Wilson,
of the Blenheim, were also to join the landing force. A small
detachment of the royal artillery was to be under the command
of Captain Knowles, R.A., having under him the Honourable C.
Spencer; and one twenty-four pounder howitzer, with two six-pounder
guns, one from the Wellesley, and one from the Melville,
were to be landed, together with thirty seamen, to be attached to
them for the purpose of placing them in position; also fifteen
men from the Blenheim were to be employed in the rocket and
ammunition service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>In front of the Chinese entrenchments there was a ridge, by
which, in a manner they were commanded, and upon the crest of
this the guns were to be placed. While this was being done,
strong covering parties were to be pushed in advance, and to act
according to circumstances, waiting for the effect of the fire from
the guns, as well as from the ships, which were to be placed in
the best positions for silencing the batteries.</p>

<p>The whole of the force on shore was under the command of
Major Pratt, of the Cameronians, and comprised altogether about
one thousand five hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>As regards the naval force engaged, it was ordered, that the
Queen and Nemesis steamers should proceed to take up a position
within good shelling distance, according as the depth of water
would permit; and at once to commence firing into the fort upon
the summit of the hill. Having rendered this post untenable,
and having watched the advance of the troops, which might be
selected to take possession of it, they were then immediately to
attack the lower fort, along the shore near the northern point, if
it should not have been already abandoned or carried. Meanwhile,
the fire from the fort above, by this time expected to be
in possession of a portion of our troops, was also to be turned
in the same direction; and, when the enemy should be driven
out, they were to be "dealt with" by the remaining part of the
troops.</p>

<p>The Madagascar and Enterprise steamers, as soon as they had
landed their troops, were to join the division under Captain (now
Sir Thomas) Herbert, in the Calliope, having with him, the Larne,
Captain Blake, and the Hyacinth, Captain Warren. They were
directed to proceed to attack the batteries, towards the northern
extremity, as well as in front, and to be prepared to proceed to
capture some of the numerous war-junks, which were seen at
anchor at the bottom of Anson's Bay. The two steamers above-mentioned,
were also to hold themselves in readiness to go alongside
any ship that might chance to require their services.</p>

<p>Captain Belcher, of the Sulphur surveying vessel, was to take
upon himself the general charge of the steamers, in the first
instance, so far as concerned "the placing them in a position
already ascertained by him;" which, probably, referred to the
position to be taken up for shelling the upper fort, as well as to
the point of debarkation for the troops.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the plan of attack upon Chuenpee; that of
Tycocktow will follow better when the account of the Chuenpee
action is completed.</p>

<p>The landing and re-embarkation of the forces was under the
direction of Lieutenant Symons, of the Wellesley, and the whole
of it was conducted with great regularity. The landing of any
considerable body of troops is always an exciting scene; but,
now, for the first time in the history of China, if we except the
trifling affair at the barrier at Macao, European troops were
about to meet in battle the sons of the "flowery nation," upon
the very soil of the "Celestial Empire." Nor did the Chinese
shrink from the contest in the first instance, for they had yet to
learn the irresistible power of European warfare, and the destructive
efficacy of European weapons.</p>

<p>The leading troops were the royal marines and the royal artillery,
the guns being dragged along by the blue jackets. The
road lay through a winding valley for nearly the distance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
couple of miles, until it led to a transverse ridge, from which,
the whole of the Chinese works could be viewed, consisting of a
strong, entrenched camp, flanked by small field-batteries of recent
and hasty construction, and connected with the Hill Fort above,
by a high breastwork continued up the hill towards it.</p>

<p>The object of the Chinese was evidently to protect the rear of
the fort, which was plainly the key of the position. In the rear
of their field-batteries were deep trenches for giving shelter to
their men from our shot, and the Chinese could be seen lining
the works, and waving their flags in defiance.</p>

<p>The guns of the royal artillery were soon in position upon the
ridge, and began firing with great precision into the entrenched
camp; while an advanced party of the royal marines, crossing
the shoulder of the hill to the right, drove the Chinese speedily
from it; and, then, descending into the valley beyond, came upon
a second encampment, with a small field-battery, which was soon
cleared. A detachment of the 37th M.N. Infantry had also been
sent further round to the right of the advance, where they encountered
the Chinese in some force.</p>

<p>While all these operations were going on, The Queen and the
Nemesis steamers (the latter having first rapidly disembarked
her portion of the 37th, with the main body of the force) took
up a position within good shelling distance of the Hill Fort.
The Nemesis, from her light draught of water, was enabled to
take up her station <i>inside</i> The Queen, and both vessels commenced
throwing shell with great precision into the fort, much to
the astonishment of the Chinese, who were unacquainted with
this engine of destruction.</p>

<p>Captain Hall had on this occasion, as on several subsequent
ones, the able assistance, as a gunnery officer, of Mr. Crouch,
one of the mates of the Wellesley, who was permitted to serve
for a time on board the Nemesis.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese could not long withstand the fire of the sixty-eight
pounder of The Queen, and the two thirty-two pounder
pivot-guns of the Nemesis, the shells from which could be seen
bursting within the walls of the fort.</p>

<p>At the same time, on the land-side, the principal entrenched
camp had by this time, been carried by the main body of the
troops, and, twenty-five minutes after the shelling of the fort had
commenced, the British flag was seen waving upon its top, and
the firing ceased. Major Pratt himself, with only two marines,
had been the first to run up the hill and reach the fort; upon
which, the Chinese, seeing that they were pressed behind as well
as before, abandoned the fort in great confusion, leaving Major
Pratt and his followers in possession of this most important
position, upon which the British flag was hoisted by a royal
marine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>The Nemesis, as soon as this was perceived, hastened on to
join the ships of war, (the Calliope, Larne, and Hyacinth,) which
had taken up their positions, nearly within musket-shot of the
lower batteries, and were doing great execution. The works were
however, constructed of strong material, comprising large blocks
of the composition called chunam, very much resembling stone
but less fragile. The Nemesis came up just in time to pour in
several discharges of grape and canister from both the pivot-guns,
and had then to witness one of the most dreadful spectacles of
war. The Chinese in the battery had already been assailed by
our troops from the fort above; and now, a party of the royal
marines, and the 37th M.N.I., which had previously cleared
the second camp in the valley behind, were seen coming round
the hill, ready to pounce upon them as they attempted to escape
out of the fort. The unfortunate men were thus hemmed in on
all sides; and, being unacquainted with the humane practice of
modern warfare, of giving and receiving quarter, they abandoned
themselves to the most frantic despair.</p>

<p>Now were to be seen some of those horrors of war which, when
the excitement of the moment is over, and the interest as well as
danger of strategic man&oelig;uvres are at an end, none can remember
without regret and pain. The Chinese, not accepting quarter,
though attempting to escape, were cut up by the fire of our
advancing troops; others, in the faint hope of escaping what to
them appeared certain death at the hands of their victors,
precipitated themselves recklessly from the top of the battlements;
numbers of them were now swimming in the river, and
not a few vainly <i>trying</i> to swim, and sinking in the effort; some
few, however, perhaps a hundred, surrendered themselves to our
troops, and were soon afterwards released. Many of the poor
fellows were unavoidably shot by our troops, who were not only
warmed with the previous fighting, but exasperated because the
Chinese had fired off their matchlocks at them first, and then
threw them away, as if to ask for quarter; under these circumstances,
it could not be wondered at that they suffered. Some
again barricaded themselves within the houses of the fort, a last
and desperate effort; and, as several of our soldiers were wounded
by their spears, death and destruction were the consequence.</p>

<p>The slaughter was great; nor could it be easily controlled when
the men were irritated by the protracted and <i>useless</i> attacks which
were made upon them from behind walls and hiding-places, even
<i>after</i> the British flag was hoisted. It is wonderful that the
casualties among the men were not more numerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The commandant of the fort was killed at the head of his men;
and it is related that his son, as soon as he found that his father
was dead, resolving not to survive him, and being unable to
avenge his death, jumped into the sea, in spite of all remonstrance,
and was drowned.</p>

<p>Those who have witnessed the individual bravery, be it courage
or be it despair, frequently exhibited by the Chinese during the
war, in almost every encounter, will be slow to stamp them as
a cowardly people, however inefficient they may be as fighting
men in armed bodies, against European discipline and modern
weapons.</p>

<p>The most painful of all the scenes on this occasion was that of
the bodies of men burnt perhaps to death when wounded.</p>

<p>It is well known that the bow and arrow is the favourite weapon
of the Tartar troops, upon the dexterous use of which they set
the highest claim to military distinction. The spear also, of
various forms and fashions, is a favourite weapon both of Tartars
and Chinese; but the matchlock, which in all respects very
nearly resembles some of the old European weapons of the same
name, except that the bore is generally somewhat smaller, is of
much more modern introduction, and by no means so much in
favour with the Chinese; this is occasioned principally by the
danger arising from the use of the powder, in the careless way
in which they carry it. They have a pouch in front, fastened
round the body, and the powder is contained loose in a certain
number of little tubes inside the pouch, not rolled up like our
cartridges.</p>

<p>Of course, every soldier has to carry a match or port-fire to
ignite the powder in the matchlock when loaded. Hence, when
a poor fellow is wounded and falls, the powder, which is very
apt to run out of his pouch over his clothes, is very likely to be
ignited by his own match, and in this way he may either be
blown up at once, or else his clothes may be ignited; indeed, it
is not impossible that the match itself may be sufficient to produce
this effect. At Chuenpee, many bodies were found after
the action not only scorched, but completely burnt, evidently from
the ignition of the powder.</p>

<p>In one of the latest encounters during the war, at Chapoo,
where a few of the Tartars defended themselves so desperately in
a house in which they had taken refuge, they were seen stripping
themselves altogether, in order to escape the effect of the fire
upon their combustible clothes when the building was in flames;
and many other instances of a similar kind were noticed during
the war.</p>

<p>With respect to the attack upon the fort at Tycocktow, on the
opposite side of the river, the Nemesis was not concerned in that
part of the operations of the 7th January. The force employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on that service was placed under the orders of Captain Scott, of
the Samarang, 26; and consisted, in addition to that vessel, of
the Druid, 44, Captain Smith; the Modeste, 18, Commander
Eyres; and Columbine, 16, Commander Clarke. Captain Scott
was directed to proceed to attack the forts upon Tycocktow, and
to dismantle them, spiking the guns, and destroying the forts as
much as possible; after which, he was to take up a convenient
position in reference to the expected operations against the
proper Bogue forts higher up.</p>

<p>Captain Scott led the way gallantly in the Samarang, without
returning the fire of the Chinese, until he dropped anchor within
cable's length of the middle of the fort. The Modeste, Druid,
and Columbine came up almost directly after, and then commenced
the terrific thunder of artillery, which soon sufficed to
shatter the walls, and to make a breach, through which the
seamen and marines, which were landed from the ships, soon
carried the fort by storm. The Chinese fled in all directions up
the hill, but not without witnessing, to their cost, the deadly
effect of our musketry upon their confused bodies; nor did they
yield without shewing some instances of bold personal courage.</p>

<p>The attack was led by Lieutenant Bowers, first lieutenant of
the Samarang, who received a sabre cut across the knee; which
shews that the Chinese did not run away without first coming to
close quarters; their loss, however, was considerable. The guns
in the fort were all spiked, and then thrown into the sea; the
magazines and other buildings were set on fire, (the wounded
having been first removed;) but it was not thought necessary to
pursue the Chinese further.</p>

<p>As soon as these operations had been completed, the whole of
the party which had landed, comprising the boats' crews of all the
ships engaged, returned on board. Part of them had proceeded
to attack the northern end of the fort, namely, those of the Druid
and Columbine, and were commanded by Lieutenant Goldsmith,
(since promoted,) and great praise was given to all the officers
and men concerned, for their gallantry and good conduct. The
number of guns destroyed was twenty-five; those which were
captured at Chuenpee amounted altogether to sixty-six pieces, of
various calibre, including those in the entrenchments, as well as
those upon the upper and lower forts. Many of the guns, however,
were not mounted, shewing that the preparations for defence
had not been completed; some were only 6-pounders, but a great
portion of the remainder were about equal to our own 12-pounder
guns. Of course, they were all rendered unserviceable.</p>

<p>The operations of this day have not yet, however, been all
described. So far as relates to Chuenpee and Tycocktow, little
remains to be added, except that the killed and wounded, on the
part of the land force, on our side, amounted to thirty; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that of the naval force, to eight men and officers. But the
destruction of the war-junks in Anson's Bay also formed part of
the feats of this day; and, as it more particularly relates to the
Nemesis, it shall be reserved for a separate chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>The total destruction of the Chinese squadron of war-junks,
on the day of the action of Chuenpee, (7th January,) under the
orders of Admiral Kwan, completed the discomfiture of the
Chinese by sea and by land. The engagement took place in
Anson's Bay, which has already been described as lying between
Chuenpee and Anunghoy. The Nemesis here took a most distinguished
part; and some of the boats of the Calliope, Hyacinth,
Larne, Sulphur, and Starling, co-operated with her in the
action, in which Lieutenants Watson and Harrison, and other
officers of the Calliope and Larne, deservedly won their laurels.</p>

<p>At the bottom of Anson's Bay was the entrance of a small
river, unknown until now, having a small island at its mouth,
somewhat on the Chuenpee side. Within this, and in a measure
protected by a sand-bar which ran out from it, lay the
Chinese fleet of about fifteen war-junks, moored in a good position
in shallow water, so as to prevent the near approach of our
ships. Directions had been given to Captain Herbert, of the
Calliope, to make arrangements for the attack of these war-junks,
as soon as the defences on Chuenpee should have fallen. The
moment, therefore, that it was perceived on board the Nemesis,
as she ran up towards the lower battery, and poured in her grape
and canister, that the upper fort had fallen, and that the lower
one could not longer hold out, she hastened, without a moment's
delay, to the attack of the enemy's squadron. Full steam was
set on, without waiting to see what other measures might be
taken elsewhere to effect the object.</p>

<p>In her anxiety to secure the post of honour, the Nemesis
rounded the point of Chuenpee a little too close, and struck
rather heavily upon a rocky reef running out some distance from
it, but upon which it was thought that there was still water
enough to enable her to float safely. She did indeed pass over
it, but not without striking; but her iron frame did not <i>hang</i>
upon it as a wooden one would probably have done, and she
proceeded, without even stopping her engines. That the force
of the blow however was considerable, and would probably have
seriously damaged a wooden vessel, is shewn by the fact of her
having the outer paddle-ring of one of the wheels broken, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
with two of the long arms attached to it. It is evident
that a blow which would cause such injury to <i>iron</i> would have
done much more serious damage to wood.</p>

<p>About this time, Captain Belcher, of the Sulphur, joined her,
with two of his ship's boats, anxious to partake of the honour of
the affair. A few of the Sulphur's seamen also came on board.
As she pushed along, she was also reinforced by Lieutenant
Kellett, of the Starling, who brought his gig, or whale-boat, and
subsequently did good service.</p>

<p>As they approached the position in which the Chinese junks
were drawn up, it was easily perceived that it had been well
chosen, with scarcely more than five feet water round the vessels,
and that, in fact, they could not be attacked in front, except by
boats. However, the Nemesis, having the great advantage of
drawing less than six feet water, was able to approach near
enough to bring her two 32-pounder pivot-guns to bear within
good range. Just at this moment also a large boat, or pinnace,
of the Larne, was observed, making its way round the outside
of the little island, with a view to cut off the junks in the rear.</p>

<p>The boldness of this man&oelig;uvre, under the command of Lieutenant
Harrison, was much admired; and, indeed, the dashing
way in which many similar attacks were made on other occasions
during the war took the Chinese by surprise, and struck them
with a wholesome terror, even before they came to close quarters.</p>

<p>One of the most formidable engines of destruction which any
vessel, particularly a steamer, can make use of is the Congreve
rocket, a most terrible weapon when judiciously applied, especially
where there are combustible materials to act upon. The
very first rocket fired from the Nemesis<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> was seen to enter the
large junk against which it was directed, near that of the admiral,
and almost the instant afterwards it blew up with a terrific explosion,
launching into eternity every soul on board, and pouring
forth its blaze like the mighty rush of fire from a volcano.
The instantaneous destruction of the huge body seemed appalling
to both sides engaged. The smoke, and flame, and thunder
of the explosion, with the broken fragments falling round, and
even portions of dissevered bodies scattering as they fell, were
enough to strike with awe, if not with fear, the stoutest heart
that looked upon it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>It is related that, at the battle of the Nile, when the French
admiral's ship, L'Orient, blew up, both of the fiercely-fighting
foes paused in horror at the dreadful catastrophe, and neither
side renewed the fight for at least ten minutes afterwards. So
here also, although the explosion was far less violent, and the
contending parties comparatively trifling in number, and far less
excited by the contest, there was a momentary pause; the very
suddenness of the catastrophe added something to the awe and
rejoicing, combined, which it excited. The rocket had penetrated
into the magazine of the junk, or had ignited some of the
loose powder too often scattered carelessly about the decks by
the Chinese gunners. They naturally felt that the same fate
might readily befall any of the other junks; and, after some discharges
of round shot had been thrown into the nearest junks,
(four of them were afterwards found lodged in the admiral's junk,)
their crews were observed endeavouring to escape on shore, some
upon the little island, and others upon Chuenpee; while, at the
same time, the junks were all cut away by those remaining on
board, in order that they might drift on shore, and enable the
rest to escape.</p>

<p>The Chinese hauled down their colours on board their junks
at about half-past eleven, but continued firing afterwards. At
about twelve o'clock, the boats of the Nemesis, in company with
the others which were present, put off to board the junks. Only
two of the smaller ones succeeded in getting away up a small
branch of the river, while two more escaped for the moment up
another principal branch to a large town, but were subsequently
captured.</p>

<p>Some of the junks drifted on shore; and, as there could be no
utility in saving them, they were all successively set on fire, by
order of Captain Belcher, and ultimately blew up. In some of
the junks which were not yet quite abandoned by their crews,
the poor Chinamen, as the English sailors boarded them on one
side, rushed wildly over on the opposite one, or let themselves
down by the stern chains, clinging to the ship's rudder. Others,
as the fire gained upon their junk, retreated before it, and continued
hanging to the yet untouched portions of it, until the
flames advancing upon them rapidly, they were obliged to throw
water <i>over their own bodies</i> to enable them to bear the intense
heat, still desperately clinging to their fate, more from fear of
ill-treatment, if they should be taken prisoners, than from any
rational hope of being saved. In many instances they <i>would not</i>
be saved; in others, they <i>could not</i>, and were destroyed as their
junk blew up.</p>

<p>On the following day, the principal part of the guns were
recovered, altogether upwards of eighty in number, of which
eight or ten were handsome brass Portuguese guns, 6, 9, and
12-pounders.</p>

<p>Altogether, eleven junks were destroyed on the spot. Scarcely
had this duty been completed by the different boats engaged,
when the Nemesis hastened on up the river, and at the distance
of about three miles, came upon a large town, where she found
two war-junks moored close to the shore, but abandoned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
their crews. The consternation of the people was extreme; they
were seen running away from the town in all directions; the
surrounding hills were crowded with the anxious and astonished
gazers, wondering what was going to happen next; never, of
course, having either seen or heard of a "devil ship" before, and
well knowing that her visit could only be a hostile one. It was
enough that they had already heard of the total destruction of
their fleet at the river's mouth. The place was not at all fortified,
not a shot being fired on either side.</p>

<p>The tide was now beginning to fall, and as the water was not
deep, and the bar would soon become impassable, and the day
was already far advanced, it was thought better to return without
exploring the river higher up. Accordingly, taking in tow the
two junks, the Nemesis again descended the river; but one of
the junks getting aground on the bar at the entrance, was
obliged to be left behind, while the other was taken safely down,
and soon after five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the Nemesis joined the squadron off
Chuenpee, and received the thanks of the commodore for the
services she had rendered during the day. She had received no
important damage, the paddle-box only having been injured by
a well-directed shot from one of the junks.</p>

<p>It must have been a fine sight for the troops who were in
possession of Chuenpee, to witness from the top of the hill
the encounter with, and total destruction of, this fleet; the
numerous burning masses, and the loud explosions as they blew
up; with the boats pulling about among them, lighted by the
glare of the fires. All this, added to the excitement which
always attends the being a looker-on while others are actors in
deeds of danger, must have formed a most animating spectacle.
The scenery about Anson's Bay is moreover bold and picturesque,
and the limited space in which the affair took place, must have
added something to the interest it awakened.</p>

<p>To the Chinese this had been, in all respects, a most disastrous
day. Their stone walls and their wooden walls had been alike
destroyed; and, although they might before have dreaded us by
sea, they had never until now had an opportunity of testing the
power of Europeans on land.</p>

<p>On this day, the 7th of January, 1841, the native Indian troops
and the Royal Marines constituted considerably more than two-thirds
of the whole force employed on shore.</p>

<p>The loss of many hundred killed and wounded on the Chinese
side, with something less than forty wounded and none killed on
our side, shews rather that the Chinese were deficient in proper
weapons to match their foes, than wanting in personal bravery to
meet them in the fight; and, as they were not yet acquainted
with the European mode of sparing an unresisting enemy, they
suffered great loss from unsupported and useless resistance, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
timely submission would have saved many lives. They exasperated
our troops without a chance of benefiting themselves.</p>

<p>The Chinese admiral, the fine old Kwan, lost the red ball or
button of his cap, the emblem of his rank, during the encounter
with the junks. It was reported that he wished to meet his
death at the hands of his foe, and was with some difficulty borne
off by his attendants; but this fate was reserved for him on a
future occasion, and he shewed himself a chivalrous and brave
man. The loss of his ball or button, which has certain marks
upon it which probably indicate that it is conferred by imperial
favour as an emblem of rank, seemed naturally to occasion him
the greatest possible anxiety and trouble. He, in fact, made
application for it to be returned to him, if it chanced to have
been found; and it is gratifying to know that, through the intervention
of Captain Elliot, her majesty's plenipotentiary, it was
recovered and generously restored to him.</p>

<p>The total number of guns taken or rendered unserviceable
during the operations of this day, ashore and afloat, amounted to
one hundred and seventy-three pieces, including eighty-two in
the junks, of which a few were brass, but mostly of small
calibre.</p>

<p>The junks with which the Nemesis was engaged in Anson's
Bay were provided with quite a new sort of boarding-nettings, if
they can be so called. Probably old Admiral Kwan, whose
reputation as a seaman was not very great, had heard that
English ships of war were sometimes provided with nets when
going into action; and, therefore, without knowing very well
what might be the purpose of them, he determined to have them
likewise. But he made a sad mistake concerning the object for
which they were intended. He very naturally thought, that, in
the position which he had taken up in shallow water, only the
boats of the squadron could come close to him, and he hit upon
the bright notion of trying to <i>catch them</i> with his nets, just as a
poacher catches his sleeping game by throwing a net over them.
A number of strong fishing-nets were fastened all round the sides
of the junks, not extended so as to impede any one trying to get
on board, but triced up outside over each of the guns, in such a
way, that, when our boats should come alongside, the nets were
to be thrown over them, men and all; and thus our jolly tars
were to be caught like hares in their form, and handed over to
the tender mercies of the emperor.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, did the guns of the Nemesis open fire,
than the nets were all forgotten in their fear of the shot and the
rockets; and, long before the boats could get alongside, the
defenders and men-catchers were glad to be off, to avoid being
themselves caught.</p>

<p>A more unwieldy-looking machine, or one less calculated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
efficient service at sea, than the old-fashioned junks, can scarcely
be conceived. Although, since the commencement of the war,
they have gradually improved them very much in the fashion of
the hull, the masts and sails, and all that appertains to the
rigging of a vessel, are very little different from what they have
hitherto been.</p>

<p>It should be noticed, that the boats and smaller rigged vessels
of the Chinese are generally very much superior to their large
junks in form and convenience of arrangement, and often sail
very well. The family to whom the boat belongs lives entirely
on board, and, for the combined purposes for which their boats
are generally used, perhaps no arrangement could be better
adapted for making the most of a limited space; and they are,
moreover, kept remarkably clean.</p>

<p>The war-junks are of different sizes, and have guns varying in
number from four to fourteen, and even more, mounted upon
them, of various calibre, some of foreign make, but principally
Chinese. The smaller junks are also adapted for oars or sweeps,
of which they sometimes can work as many as twenty on either
side. The crew are further provided with a great number of
spears, swords, matchlocks, and frequently large jingals, not
unlike our musquetoons, fitted with a rest upon the bulwarks of
the vessel, so as to give the power of taking a steady aim. There
are generally a large number of round shields on board, made in
a saucer-like fashion, and about two and a half to three feet in
diameter. They are composed of ratans, or canes, strongly
twisted or woven in together, and are so elastic, that it would be
very difficult to cut through them with a sword; and even a
musket-ball fired from a long distance, and hitting them at all in
a slanting direction, would be turned off. They are usually hung
all round the bulwarks, resting upon the top and outside of them,
giving a very striking appearance.</p>

<p>A large junk puts one very much in mind of one of the old
Roman galleys, only it is less efficiently constructed for venturing
away from land, and is not unfrequently gaudily ornamented with
green and yellow colours.</p>

<p>Several improvements have been adopted by the Chinese since
the commencement of the war. They had constructed a number
of gun-boats for the defence of the river higher up, upon
European models; and, towards the close of the war, they built
one or two large junks, which they called frigates, with great
improvements in shape and general arrangement, and regular
port-holes for the guns on the deck below, and with heavy guns,
too, mounted in them. One of these we saw near the Bogue,
after the peace, mounting thirty-six guns, all of foreign manufacture,
many of them 9 and 12-pounder iron guns, made by
Fawcett, of Liverpool, and purchased either at Macao or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Singapore. The junk was very clean, and in good order, painted
green, and coppered; and, with the exception of the masts and
sails, which were in the old style, she looked very well. This
vessel was said to have been constructed by order of Tinqua, one
of the Hong merchants, who has distinguished himself by his
zeal in defence of his country; and it was by him presented to
the emperor, together with a European barque, and a brig, rather
the worse for wear in the merchant service, which he purchased
at considerable cost.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable improvement of all, and which
shewed the rapid stride towards a great change which they were
daily making, as well as the ingenuity of the Chinese character,
was the construction of several large <i>wheeled</i> vessels, which were
afterwards brought forward against us with great confidence, at
the engagement at Woosung, the last naval affair of the war, and
were each commanded by a mandarin of rank, shewing the importance
they attached to their new vessels. This, too, was so
far north as the Yangtze Keang, where we had never traded with
them; so that the idea must have been suggested to them by
the reports they received concerning the wonderful power of our
steamers or wheeled vessels.</p>

<p>To anticipate a little, it may here be mentioned, that the
vessels had wooden wheels, very like an undershot mill-wheel,
which were moved by machinery inside the vessel, worked by a
sort of capstan by manual labour, the crew walking it round and
round, just like walking up an anchor on board a man-of-war;
the horizontal revolution was turned into the upright one by
strong wooden <i>cog-wheels</i>, upon regular mechanical principles.</p>

<p>When once the spirit of change and improvement has taken
hold of the Chinese, it is impossible to say where it will stop
among so ingenious and indefatigable a people. Even the
emperor himself has ordered still greater changes to be made
since the peace, and has directed that "the best materials for
building ships shall be procured from all parts of the world; and
that, as only ships built on European principles can contend
with European ships, they must gradually learn to adopt European
models themselves. But, as this can only be effected by
time, and the ships are required now to suppress the pirates
which infest his coast, they are at once to purchase foreign ships
and learn to exercise their crews."</p>

<p>To return from this short digression, we may now ask what
sort of a report was made by Admiral Kwan to his mighty
master, upon the subject of these first actions below the Bogue&mdash;the
first great collision between the power and science of the
west and the self-confidence of the remote east. Keshen, clear-sighted
as he certainly was, could not fail to perceive the many
troubles and humiliations to which his country must become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
subjected if hostilities were pushed to extremes. He was fully
alive to the serious defeat he had sustained, yet dreaded to break
the truth too suddenly to his haughty master; wise, therefore,
in his generation, he declared there had been a "drawn
battle." He informed his master that the contest had been
maintained from eight <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> until two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and that "then, the
<i>tide ebbing</i>, the foreign vessels ceased firing, and anchored in
the middle of the stream, <i>each side maintaining its ground</i>."</p>

<p>He then details the measures he had adopted for reinforcing
the position, and apologizes for the absence of more detailed
information, upon the ground of his anxiety to communicate the
earliest possible intelligence.</p>

<p>The emperor, or rather his ministers, were not so easily to be
duped. Keshen was at once declared to be "incompetent;" and
it was ordered that his conduct "should be subjected to the
severest consideration;" while poor old Kwan was accused of
being "at all times devoid of talent to direct, and, on the approach
of a crisis to be alarmed, perturbed, and without resources."</p>

<p>From the earliest times to the most modern, success has been
vulgarly considered in all countries to be the grand criterion of
merit; and the "Felix" of the ancients, the successful, the
favoured of the gods, stands nearly as paramount in the estimation
of the world now, as it did even in days of old. Kwan was
accordingly at once deprived of his rank and insignia of office,
but was ordered henceforth to labour to attain merit, bearing his
punishment in the meantime.</p>

<p>Various plans were suggested for future proceedings against
the English; it was admitted that the junks could not cope with
our ships on the open sea, and it was therefore recommended
"that our vessels should be <i>enticed</i> into the inner waters, and
that there should be employed expert divers to go down at night,
and bore holes in their bottoms," while other parties were to
come "stealthily upon them at night and board them unawares,
and massacre the whole of their crews." Above all, a grand
preparation of fireships was to be made, filled with various combustibles,
which, with a favourable wind, were to be let loose
upon them, and, in the confusion resulting from this attack, their
war-vessels were to follow and complete what the fire-vessels had
commenced. Great rewards were again offered for the taking or
destruction of any of our ships, and 50,000 dollars was to be
the recompence for a line-of-battle ship.</p>

<p>We must now return to the current of events which took
place immediately after the capture of Chuenpee. The evening
after the engagement was spent in making preparations
on both sides for renewing the contest on the morrow. Every
one on board our ships was excited with the occurrences of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
day, and anxiously longing for the dawn of morning, when the
thunder of our artillery should make even the walls of Anunghoy
and the famed Bogue forts tremble and fall. At length the
sun rose, bright and full of promise, on the morning of the 8th.
The boats of H.M.S. Sulphur were sent out to take soundings
higher up towards the Bogue. The Nemesis was first under
weigh, and was directed to proceed at once up to Anunghoy with
a couple of rocket-boats.</p>

<p>The morning was calm: the line-of-battle ships were slowly
moving up to the positions assigned to them in front of the principal
forts; already had the Nemesis taken up a position within
capital range of the southern battery of Anunghoy, in such a
manner that only three or four guns could be brought to bear on
her from it. Already had she thrown in several shells and shot,
when the signal, for her recal was observed flying most provokingly
from the mast-head of the Wellesley, and being enforced by
more than one signal gun, the firing ceased. Just as the exciting
moment had arrived, and every man was calculating in his
own mind how soon the forts would be reduced, the stillness, not
of breathless anxiety, but of bitter disappointment, prevailed in
every man's bosom.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that old Admiral Kwan preferred to try his
skill in cunning and diplomacy rather than in war, and had sent
off a small boat to the flag-ship, under a flag of truce, with a note
addressed to the plenipotentiary. The fact has excited some
amusement, that a little boat, with an old woman and a man in it,
was sent off to bear proposals for the cessation of hostilities at
the very moment of their commencement; and that this humble
paper, sent in this extraordinary way, was received, and became
the groundwork of an armistice, which was concluded in the
course of the day.</p>

<p>Soon after four o'clock in the afternoon, the Nemesis was sent
to convey Lieutenant Maitland, of the Wellesley, to Anunghoy,
as bearer of a chop or official document, relating to the truce, and
to a projected treaty of peace, the precise terms of which did not
transpire.</p>

<p>Many animadversions were made upon this proceeding; but
Captain Elliot was placed in very peculiar circumstances. He
was, undoubtedly, desirous to avoid open rupture with the
Chinese, if possible, and to use his best tact and judgment in
negotiation, which would, of course, be of little avail unless
backed by a strong force, ready to support his claims, and, therefore,
necessarily assuming a threatening attitude. Above all, the
value of the revenue to be derived from <i>tea</i> was so great, and its
importance as an article of consumption so much thought of,
that Elliot believed himself to be best serving his country when
he best followed out, according to his judgment, these two principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
objects. That Captain Elliot may have been influenced by
occasional errors of judgment is far from improbable, but that
he was wanting in natural talent or principle, or a wish to serve
faithfully his queen, his government, and his country, his most
unscrupulous detractors have scarcely ventured to maintain. It
is fortunate, at all events, that it can still be said that measures
of uncompromising hostility were not urged until every other
method of persuasion, and every less powerful, however ingenious,
argument had been tried and found wanting.</p>

<p>Negotiations continued at the Bogue, but the Chinese, in spite
of the truce, were observed to be increasing their defences, and
notice was accordingly given to them to desist. The communications
were frequent, and, on the 17th, just a week after the
commencement of the truce, Captain Elliot went down in the
Nemesis to Macao. There seemed, however, to prevail an impression
that the affair was so far from being settled, that
another collision could scarcely be avoided, and therefore no
measure of precaution was omitted on our side.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, a circular was issued by Captain
Elliot, dated at Macao, announcing that <i>preliminary</i> arrangements
had been concluded, but reserving the details for future
negotiation. Hong-Kong was to be ceded to us; an indemnity
of six million dollars was to be paid by the Chinese in six equal
annual instalments, one million being paid down at once, and the
last in 1846; direct official intercourse was to be maintained
upon terms of perfect equality, and trade was to be resumed
within the port of Canton, within ten days. But it would also
appear that an intimation had been made of an intention to
remove the greater portion of the trade to Hong-Kong, for it was
provided that it should only continue "to be carried on at
Whampoa until further arrangements were practicable at the
new settlement."</p>

<p>Nothing could at first appear more satisfactory than this arrangement;
but, as will presently be seen, it gave ample time to
the Chinese to make further preparations for defence, and
abundant loopholes for the exercise of their crafty ingenuity. At
the same time, Captain Elliot urged upon the consideration of
his countrymen "the necessity of adopting a conciliatory treatment
towards the people, and a becoming deference for the
country upon the threshold of which we were about to be established."</p>

<p>Nothing further need here be said upon this subject, except that
on the following day, the 21st January, the Nemesis was sent to
convey two mandarins to Chuenpee, who were to receive back
the forts from Captain Scott, of the Samarang, who had been
appointed <i>pro tempore</i> governor of this fortress. The British
colours were hauled down, and the Chinese dragon was hoisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in their place, under a salute from the flag-ship; it was very
evident that no salute had ever sounded so welcome to Chinese
ears before. As soon as a few guns could be got ready for
the purpose, the salute was returned by the Chinese.</p>

<p>We had certainly shewn rather a chivalrous leniency to their
government, in thus so suddenly restoring to them one of their
principal strongholds. Indeed, everything looked extremely
peaceable upon paper, and the Chinese contrived to create a
temporary belief in the sincerity of their intentions.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Sir Gordon Bremer had not yet
been named joint plenipotentiary, which did not take place until
after his return from Calcutta in The Queen steamer, in the
month of June following. He had proceeded to India in that
vessel, at the end of March, after the arrival of Lieutenant-Gen.
Sir Hugh Gough, probably in order to confer in person with the
governor-general.</p>

<p>Thus ended what may be called the second act, (the first
having been the taking of Chusan, and the expedition to the
Peiho) of the great drama of the Chinese war. In his report to
the emperor, respecting these several occurrences, Keshen declared
that "he had only made conditional concessions to the
English; <i>merely</i> promising that he would earnestly implore the
emperor's favour in their behalf."</p>

<p>Immediately after the restoration of the forts on the 21st to
the Chinese, the commodore went down to Macao in the Nemesis,
leaving the Wellesley in the Lintao passage, the main body of
the fleet having proceeded to Hong-Kong. It was feared, however,
that things could not long remain in <i>statu quo</i>; and on the
26th, Captain Elliot himself left Macao in the Nemesis, and
went up the Canton river to hold a conference, which it had
been arranged should take place with Keshen in person, in order
to settle those points which, it has been stated, were reserved for
future consideration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>The famous conference which took place between Keshen and
Captain Elliot, some miles above the Bogue, close to a pagoda
on the banks of the river, at what is called its Second Bar, has
attracted very great and deserved attention. Although its results
were, in a political point of view, really of little moment, there is
reason to think that Keshen, as well as Elliot, was anxious to
adjust the pending difficulties without further resort to arms.
The advantage, however, which delay of any kind would afford
to Keshen, and the ultimate interruption of the negotiations,
followed, as it was, immediately by the capture of the Bogue
forts, have led many to conclude that Keshen had all along no
other object than that of putting us off our guard, in order that
he might complete his still imperfect arrangements for defence,
and then throw down the gauntlet to us in defiance.</p>

<p>This view of the matter appears to have been a good deal
exaggerated; and we shall perceive, as we follow this narrative,
that Keshen was thoroughly sensible of his own weakness, and
really did desire to avert the storm, but was fairly driven into
extreme measures, and the suspension of all amicable intercourse,
by positive orders from Pekin. Indeed, he was afterwards
accused of treason, bribery, and incapacity, because he even condescended
to confer at all with Captain Elliot, instead of advancing
boldly upon him, and driving him and all his troops and
ships away from the coast. Keshen saw the imbecility of such
conduct, and although he knew the hopelessness of an attempt
to defend the river, he had no other alternative but to obey; he
had already been deprived of some of his decorations for having
listened to terms at Chuenpee, and his only hope of saving
himself from ignominy, and even death itself, was by striving
hard to exhibit greater zeal in the defence of the Bogue, which,
nevertheless, he scarcely hoped to be able to maintain.</p>

<p>Let us now, however, accompany the Nemesis up the river, in
order to see what sort of an affair the grand conference at the
Second Bar really was, and how the interview between the plenipotentiary
of England and the high-commissioner of China
actually came off. It was naturally expected that it would be an
affair of great ceremony, and as it was the first time that any
intercourse had been permitted upon terms of perfect equality
with any of the high Canton authorities, and as it was to happen
in accordance with the stipulations of the new treaty, it excited
great interest, and kept the curiosity of every one alive.</p>

<p>Adequate preparations were made on both sides, becoming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
high rank of the respective parties, and doubtless each of them
was calculating the most likely mode of making a good impression
upon the other. One hundred marines, picked men
from the Wellesley, Druid, and Calliope, were embarked on board
the Madagascar steamer, to be carried up as a guard of honour
for Captain Elliot, at the meeting; they were commanded by
Captain, now Lieutenant-Colonel, Ellis, C.B., having with him
Lieutenants Stransham and Maxwell. The excellent bands of
the Wellesley and Calliope were also in attendance, and it was
expected that the Chinese would be astonished and properly
"impressed" by the appearance and man&oelig;uvres of the men,
while they would be gratified and put into a good humour by
the enlivening tones of the music.</p>

<p>On the 26th of January the Nemesis started from Macao, with
Captain Elliot and several officers on board, and proceeded directly
up the Bogue. She was subsequently joined by the Madagascar,
which was to accompany her up to the place of meeting.
Captain Herbert, the Honourable Captain Dundas, and
Captain Maitland, attended the plenipotentiary. And now, for
the first time, two steamers were to enter the true Canton river,
and as the Nemesis was the leading vessel through the Bogue,
she had, consequently, the honour of being the first steam vessel,
whether of wood or iron, which ever navigated the "inner
waters" of the Celestial Empire.</p>

<p>It was just at this time that the French corvette, Danaide,
arrived in the China waters, having been sent out purposely to
watch our movements in that quarter. This, indeed, could have
been her only object, for, as regards protection of trade, the
French have never had any trade with China worthy of the name,
nor indeed had the French flag floated over the walls of the
foreign factories at Canton for many years, until after the accession
of Louis Philippe to the throne. Since that time it has
always been exhibited rather in hope of the future than for the
protection of present interests, for, except the French consul and
his attendants, there has been, until recently, scarcely a French
ship in China.</p>

<p>As the declaration of blockade was still in force against the
port of Canton, the Danaide was not permitted to proceed higher
up than Chuenpee, but her commander, Captain Rosamel, was
politely invited by Captain Elliot to accompany him on board
the Nemesis, that he might be a witness of the coming interview;
an act of courtesy which was handsomely acknowledged.</p>

<p>As the two steamers passed through the Bogue, each with a
flag of truce at the fore, they were saluted with three guns (the
greatest number ever given in China,) by the forts on both sides.
The Chinese also manned the works, and hoisted numerous gay
silken flags; and the effect of their curious costumes, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
general appearance of the forts of Anunghoy and Wantung
when their battlements were crowded with the eager spectators,
were very imposing. Certainly, the passage of two steamers
between them, the first they had ever seen, must have been an
exciting novelty. The bold, rocky steeps behind the batteries of
Anunghoy, frowning, as it were, and really commanding the batteries
below, grinning defiance with their whitened battlements,
and the opposite island of Wantung, with its numerous works,
the more distant shore of the mainland on the other side, and
the remarkable Tiger Island ahead; all these formed a very interesting
and remarkable spectacle.</p>

<p>Just at the foot of Tiger Island, about two miles above the
Bogue, could be distinguished a long stone battery, which, on
a nearer approach, appeared deserving of closer inspection,
although, from its position, it was not likely to be of much use for
the defence of the river. The Nemesis, accordingly, little fearing
shallow water at any time, ran up towards it, and came so close
to the battlements as to touch them with her yards; in which
position, had her intentions been hostile, it was very evident
that she could batter the walls with her guns with perfect impunity,
for the guns of the fort could not be depressed sufficiently
to point at her hull in that position.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre thoroughly confounded the Chinese, who
looked on in evident wonder. And they so far profited by the
hint afterwards, that they abandoned the fort altogether as useless
and untenable, and carried away the guns to add to the
strength of the Bogue forts lower down.</p>

<p>Beyond the Bogue and Tiger Island the river begins to expand
again, and for some miles presents to view a flat, rich, alluvial
country, in which are an immense number of canals and water-courses,
serving to irrigate the paddy or rice fields, and to afford
innumerable lines of internal communication, which in that
country mostly take the place of roads and bridges.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>It was precisely at the pagoda at the Second Bar, as it is
called, that the conference was now to be held; and there, at
about six o'clock in the evening, the Nemesis and Madagascar
came to anchor. A couple of mandarins, or officers of inferior
grade, (for let it not be supposed that a mandarin is necessarily
a great man) came on board, deputed by Keshen, to welcome the
arrival of the plenipo.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>A list of the names and rank of those officers who were to be
present at the interview on the following morning, was sent in to
Keshen, in English and Chinese, so that he might be quite prepared,
when each gentleman should be presented to him by
Captain Elliot, to receive him courteously.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the guard of marines were landed, together
with the bands of the Wellesley and Calliope. A finer
body of men is rarely seen. Soon after nine o'clock, the whole
of the officers were ready to go on shore, which was accomplished
partly in the boats of the two steamers, partly in very clean and
convenient Chinese boats provided by Keshen. They had to
pull some little distance up one of the numerous creeks which
open into all the Chinese rivers, and the scene as they approached
was very novel and interesting. On either side were
several very gaudily ornamented boats belonging to Keshen, very
similar to the boats of the Hong merchants at Canton, who had
also arrived under the guidance of old Howqua.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They could
scarcely hope to enjoy the honour of a place at the conference,
and were, therefore, probably ordered by Keshen to attend upon
him. They were not admitted even into the same tents with
Captain Elliot and his suite.</p>

<p>The guard of marines drawn up on either side highly astonished
the Chinese, but the people were kept from pressing too
close by a long line of railing put up for the occasion. The road
from the immediate landing-place to the grand tent was spread
over with various coloured cotton coverings, and decorated with
branches of trees.</p>

<p>At nine <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, Captain Elliot, accompanied by Captain Herbert,
and the Honourable Captain Dundas, landed, and went up in
state, preceded by the bands, to the principal tent, which was
very like a large long booth, ornamented inside with yellow
hangings, in token of its belonging to the representative of the
emperor. At the further extremity of it was another tent or
apartment, reserved more especially for Keshen's private use,
and into this only Captain Elliot and one or two officers in personal
attendance on him were admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The whole party were presented to Keshen in the outer tent
including Captain Rosamel of the Danaide; the list sent in the
previous evening being referred to, as each gentleman of the
party made his bow to the Imperial Commissioner.</p>

<p>The first private audience in the inner tent between Captain
Elliot and Keshen was merely one of ceremony, and lasted only
a few minutes; the medium of communication being through
Mr. Morrison, the interpreter, the gifted son of the late Dr. Morrison,
so celebrated as a Chinese scholar and philologist.</p>

<p>After the first introduction was over, it was announced that a
grand <i>déjeûner à la fourchette</i> was prepared in the outer tent for
the whole of the party, upwards of twenty in number. Interminable
was the succession of dishes of the rarest and most expensive
kind, according to the best Chinese principles of gastronomy.
The luxury of the shark's-fin and the bird's-nest soup
was here tasted for the first time, and, without going deeply into
the mysteries of the Chinese "cuisine," it will be sufficient to say
that a Chinese feast is a very sumptuous and tedious, but, withal
not unpalatable affair. It necessarily occupied considerable
time, and it was not until two o'clock that those officers not in
personal attendance upon Captain Elliot were able to return on
board the steamers.</p>

<p>In the interim, Keshen could not resist the wish to gratify his
curiosity concerning our fine-looking fellows the marines, and
three of the tallest and finest men were selected for his personal
examination. He did not conceal his surprise, and even requested
that they might be made to go through some of their
evolutions. Keshen also examined their arms and accoutrements
minutely.</p>

<p>He had himself a small body-guard of Chinese soldiers,
tolerably well dressed, but otherwise of poor appearance, compared
with our own picked men, and they seemed quite at a loss
to comprehend the purpose of the movements they witnessed.</p>

<p>There were a good many small tents pitched round about the
principal reception-tent, and, as each of these was ornamented
with a gay flag, and other decorations, the <i>coup-d'&oelig;il</i> of the
whole scene was sufficiently imposing.</p>

<p>Keshen's manner throughout is described as having been particularly
kind, gentlemanlike, and perfectly dignified. He might,
indeed, be called a courtier-like gentleman in any country.</p>

<p>What may have passed between Keshen and Captain Elliot,
during their <i>private</i> conference in the afternoon, it would be
useless to surmise. They met and parted upon terms of equality
and apparent good understanding. There seems reason, however,
to think that very little was definitely settled; and, after the
lapse of two or three days, Captain Elliot merely announced in
a circular that "negotiations were still proceeding satisfactorily,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
but at the same time "he warned her majesty's subjects against
proceeding to Canton for the present, as it would be acting contrary
to what he conceived right for the public interest." At the
same time, however, Hong-Kong was proclaimed a British possession,
and all its Chinese inhabitants declared to be British
subjects. Provision was also made for the government of the
island.</p>

<p>Whatever terms Keshen may have agreed to at the conference,
it is well known that he was soon forbidden by the emperor to
carry them into execution. They are therefore of little moment.</p>

<p>Captain Elliot returned on board the Nemesis in the afternoon,
apparently satisfied; and in the evening a display of rockets
and fireworks took place from the vessel, for the amusement of
the imperial commissioner on shore.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Madagascar returned down the river with
the marines. On the following day, the 28th, two superior mandarins
came on board to pay their respects, and were saluted
with three guns; and, later in the day, the whole body of the
Hong merchants likewise came to pay their respects to his excellency;
but, it is worthy of remark, that Keshen himself did
not come <i>in person</i> to make a return-visit of ceremony.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the reason of this omission, it was
unfortunate that Captain Elliot did not take some notice of it. It
might be said that Keshen was afraid of compromising himself
with his imperial master, if he condescended so far as to pay a
visit to a foreigner on board his own vessel. But it is possible
that another reason also may have weighed not a little in his
mind. He got the Kwang-Chow-Foo, or prefect of Canton, who
was there, to ask Captain Elliot to dine with him on board his
barge, or large covered boat, and his invitation was accepted.
Keshen looked upon this as far below the supposed dignity belonging
to the rank which Elliot held. After this act of condescension
on Captain Elliot's part, Keshen not improbably
regarded it as far beneath his own dignity personally to visit
Captain Elliot. Nor is it at all surprising, when we consider
that the court of China is, without exception, the most ceremonious
in the world. Indeed, at Pekin there is a regular "Court
of Ceremonies" to arrange all the complicated details.</p>

<p>Thus ended the whole business of this famous conference. It
should also be mentioned that, before they parted, Keshen made
a few presents to Captain Elliot, but not of any very great value,
and others to Captain Herbert, which were divided among some
of the officers. Soon after three o'clock the steam was once
more got up, and giving and receiving a parting salute of three
guns, the Nemesis turned her head again down the river, having
the Louisa cutter in tow. The forts at the Bogue again saluted her
as she passed; and, late in the evening, she came to anchor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the Tong Koo Roads, until daylight enabled her to proceed to
join the commodore, who was then in Hong-Kong harbour.</p>

<p>As yet the treaty, in virtue of which we took possession of
Hong-Kong, had not received the emperor's assent; and our
own precipitate restoration of Chusan, which had been ordered
by Captain Elliot, was likely rather to impede than to promote
the object it was intended to effect. The mere word of Keshen
was the only authority which we had to rely upon, the ratification
of which was at least doubtful. However, both the commodore
and Captain Elliot seemed already to regard the island of Hong-Kong
as a positive acquisition, and took the present opportunity
of steaming all round it on board the Nemesis.</p>

<p>Little good appears to have resulted from this first interview.
Indeed, shortly after his report of it to the emperor, Keshen
received a severe reprimand from the emperor for what he had
already even <i>pretended to promise</i>. He was told that "a mere
glance at his memorials had filled the emperor with indignation."</p>

<p>Yih-shan, a Tartar general of great repute, and who will be found
to figure afterwards on several occasions, was now sent down to
Canton, invested with the office of "general pacificator of the
rebellious;" and two assistant functionaries, called Lung-Wan and
Yang-Fang, were also ordered to repair thither, "to co-operate
in the work of extermination." Additional troops were also
despatched.</p>

<p>These orders of the emperor were issued on the 30th of
January, but did not reach Keshen until the 10th or 11th of
February. On our side nothing important took place for several
days; arrangements connected with the establishment of Hong-Kong
were continued; and there was a constant passing to and
fro of officers between that place and Macao, for which purpose
the Nemesis was always employed.</p>

<p>The 2nd of February was the day on which it had been agreed
with Keshen that the trade of the port of Canton should be
opened&mdash;namely, ten days after the Chinese new year. No
proclamation to that effect, however, was issued by the commissioner.
Various rumours were already afloat concerning the
measures in progress up the river for obstructing its navigation;
and, at length, finding that the "satisfactory manner" in which
it had been proclaimed on the 30th of January, that the negotiations
which were proceeding had already, in the following week,
assumed an "unsatisfactory tone," and that, in fact, everything
appeared very delusive, Captain Elliot determined to go up to
the Bocca Tigris in person, and demand a distinct explanation
from Keshen of what were really his intentions. It was known
that Keshen had reached the Bogue; and Captain Herbert had
even sent an officer to compliment him upon his arrival on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
29th of January, and a salute of three guns was fired in honour
of the occasion. On the 10th of February, Captain Elliot embarked
on board the Nemesis, accompanied by Captain Smith
and Captain Knowles, of the artillery, together with Major
Pratt, of the Cameronians, and Mr. Morrison as interpreter, and
was conveyed up the river, anchoring for the night in Anson's
Bay.</p>

<p>On the following morning they once more passed through the
Bogue, the battlements of which were manned by the Chinese,
as the steamer passed; and a salute of three guns was fired
from each of the batteries, which was of course returned by the
Nemesis. So far everything looked pacific and complimentary
enough. Having passed completely through the Bogue, she
came to anchor, about ten o'clock, above the forts, a little to the
north of Anunghoy, and close to the boats of the imperial commissioner,
who was already there. This was on the 11th of
February; and it is a curious coincidence, that it was on this
day that Keshen received the imperial commands to resume
vigorous measures against Captain Elliot and all the foreigners.</p>

<p>The interview on this occasion was comparatively one of little
ceremony; indeed, Keshen had made no preparation for it on
shore, and received Captain Elliot in his own covered barge,
unattended by any mandarins of rank, and without any display
or attempt at effect.</p>

<p>Captain Elliot, on his part, having merely introduced the
officers who came up with him from Macao, in order that they
might make their bow of respect to the emperor's representative,
immediately proceeded to business without loss of time, in the
most private manner possible. During the few minutes that his
suite were present, however, it did not escape their notice that
some mighty change had already come over the spirit of the
great commissioner. There was an appearance of constraint
about him, as if his mind was downcast, and his heart burdened
and heavily laden. He never indeed for a moment lost his self-possession,
or that dignified courtesy of manner which no people
can better assume than the Chinese of rank; but there was still
something undefinable in his bearing, which impressed upon all
present the conviction that something untoward had happened.
Some of the party even guessed that he had been degraded from
his high rank, which was, in fact, the case. Enough, at all
events, was visible upon the surface, to awaken Captain Elliot
to the necessity of extreme tact and caution, before he placed
any reliance upon Keshen's power, whatever may have been his
<i>will</i>, to act up to his promises.</p>

<p>What may have passed at this second interview between these
two high representatives it is not the place here to discuss; suffice
it to say, that the conference on this day lasted no less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
six hours, and was renewed on the following morning for about
three hours more. This will be enough to shew that many
points of great importance and some minuteness must have been
closely debated.</p>

<p>Keshen, meantime, was doubtless fully aware, that not one
single iota of what he might promise would ever be acceded to
by his haughty master; and, therefore, his only object in protracting
the discussion and entering into the "troublesome
minutiæ of commerce" must have been to leave something still
<i>open</i> to discussion, and some points remaining to investigate
"upon principles of the purest reason."</p>

<p>How great must have been his rejoicing when he at length
succeeded in winning from Captain Elliot a further delay of ten
days, for the fair preparation of a definitive treaty for his signature!
What a heavy weight must have been removed from his
oppressed spirit, when he at length beheld the dreaded steamer
depart peaceably from the Bogue! The certain reprieve of ten
days, in which he might, perhaps, complete the preparations
already commenced, and even far advanced for the defence of
his strongest positions, was indeed a piece of unlooked-for good
fortune.</p>

<p>The formal drawing out of the definitive treaty was hastened
on, in order that every excuse for further delay on the part of
Keshen might be removed. Indeed, ten days had only been fixed
as the <i>longest</i> period, within which, if the treaty were not executed,
hostilities would be renewed.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, it redounded to our credit that extreme
measures were only at length adopted, when every other means
of effecting a settlement had been tried in vain. Forbearance
towards a feeble enemy, as long as there was the faintest hope of
bringing him to reason by simpler means, will redound more to
our honour in the pages of future history, than a precipitate display
of our energy and our power. At all events the treaty which
was ultimately concluded was much more advantageous to commerce
and civilization in general than it would probably have
been had an earlier settlement taken place. The Chinese were
brought to yield by <i>degrees</i>, and, therefore, the compact is much
more likely to be durable than if it had been wrung from them
by an earlier and more sudden emergency.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before even the draught of the proposed treaty
had been fully drawn up at Macao, rumours were continually
brought concerning the extensive preparations for defence which
were still going on up the river. Some naval and military
officers were accordingly sent up to the Bogue, to ascertain how
far these rumours might be well founded; and it was now discovered
"that military works upon a great scale were in progress,
that troops were collected upon the heights, that entrenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
camps were being formed on both sides of the river, and that the
island of North Wantung was bristling with cannon."</p>

<p>These preparations certainly looked very unlike the preliminaries
to the signature of a treaty of peace; "and from this
moment," says Sir Gordon Bremer, "I must confess that my
faith in the sincerity of the Chinese commissioner was completely
destroyed." It was in fact to be no longer doubted that
hostilities would be speedily resumed. And although the orders
of the emperor to Keshen to cancel the treaty agreed on, and to
provide means for the immediate extermination of the foreigners
had not then been made public, enough was already known to
make it evident that the intentions of the government were very
far from being of a peaceful nature.</p>

<p>On his side, Captain Elliot had done his utmost to impress the
Chinese with a confidence in his "good faith;" and so anxious
was he to hasten the evacuation of Chusan, that he had not only
sent up a vessel of war to convey the necessary orders, but had
also forwarded an <i>overland despatch</i>, by the hands of a Chinese
special messenger, to the same purport.</p>

<p>Scarcely a month, however, had elapsed when Captain Elliot
began to doubt whether the Chinese really meant to act up to
<i>their</i> promises with equal good faith. On the 20th of January,
he had declared, in a public proclamation, that he had no reason
to call in question the "scrupulous sincerity and <i>enlarged
opinions</i> of the very eminent person with whom negotiations had
been pending;" and it was just a month afterwards, on the 20th
of February, that he declared that the "imperial minister and
high commissioner had failed to conclude the treaty which had
been sent up to the Bogue ready prepared for signature." This
document was carried up by the Nemesis. But, as the commissioner
had already left the Bogue and gone to Canton, it was
transmitted to him by the hands of a confidential person in the
employment of Keshen, who had been distinctly named to Captain
Elliot for the purpose. Four days were allowed for the return of
the messenger, and the Nemesis was directed to wait at the
Bogue for the answer, until the expiration of that period, when
she was to return to Macao, either with or without the treaty.</p>

<p>As the time agreed on approached its expiration, reports became
more numerous than ever, concerning the hostile preparations
in progress. The edict of the emperor addressed to
Keshen, before spoken of, was now made public, and a proclamation
was pasted on the walls of Canton, (but whether by the
orders of the viceroy or not does not appear certain,) by which a
reward of 50,000 dollars each was offered for the heads of Captain
Elliot and Sir Gordon Bremer!</p>

<p>The four days of the stay of the Nemesis at the Bogue were
not spent unprofitably. Advantage was taken of this opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by Captain Hall to examine the new works of the Chinese,
many of which were still in progress, (during a <i>truce</i> and while
a treaty of peace had been agreed on!) Numerous sand-bag
batteries had been erected, and others were in course of completion,
halfway up the hill of Anunghoy. Troops were crowding
upon the hills on the opposite side, while upon the Island of
North Wantung equal activity was displayed.</p>

<p>But the observations were not limited entirely to the works at
the Bogue. Captain Hall set out with a single boat's crew upon
an adventurous and interesting excursion up Anson's Bay, to the
mouth of the river in which the junks had been destroyed on the
day of the Chuenpee. Just within the entrance, several large
mandarin boats were now observed collected together, and surrounded
by a vast number of labouring men. This excited some
surprise, as there wore no works visible upon which they could
be employed; but the object of this bustle was unexpectedly
discovered afterwards. The mandarin boats and a great part of
the people, thinking probably that the single boat of the Nemesis
was only the advanced one of many others similar to those which
had destroyed their war-junks, made off as fast as they could,
leaving her to pursue her course unmolested.</p>

<p>Having, in the former ascent of the river in the Nemesis, observed
that a branch of it turned off to the right towards Chuenpee,
Captain Hall, determined to explore it now. It branched off
about one and a half to two miles from the entrance, and soon
led to a very considerable village on the right or Chuenpee side,
(in ascending,) while, nearly opposite to it, a large sand-battery,
recently erected, was discovered, mounting eight guns, and
further on, was a strong stone battery. Neither of these fired at
the boat, although the gunners ran down to their guns, as if
apprehensive of an attack.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of all in the boat, it was now found that
this branch of the river, or creek, or whatever it might be called,
instead of leading further up the country, inland, gradually
turned round and encircled the whole of Chuenpee, communicating
with the "outer waters" to the southward of that promontory.
Thus it was evident that Chuenpee was an island.</p>

<p>Having passed quite through the passage, so as to reach the
point of junction with the "outer waters," Captain Hall landed
on Chuenpee in company with Mr. Turner, the surgeon of the
vessel, and Mr. Gray, a midshipman of H.M.S. Herald, and,
sending the boat round the promontory to the opposite side,
walked across without any molestation. Nothing particular
worth noticing was observed in this excursion, except the large
farm-houses, which were passed, together with several extensive
sugar-works, in full operation.</p>

<p>A visit made to the Tycocktow side of the river was less promising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
although equally successful. It was thought desirable,
on the following day, to reconnoitre the defences in that direction;
and accordingly Captain Hall, accompanied by Mr. Compton, proceeded
in the ship's cutter across the river for that purpose. A
large number of troops were collected upon the heights, upon
which were numerous tents; and several large transport junks,
not less than twenty sail, were hastily landing troops, guns, and
ammunition. It was also noticed that boats were passing round
at the back of the hill and works, through a large canal or creek;
so that, although it was not possible to explore the lines of communication
from one part to the other, it became very evident
that the neighbourhood of the river, although apparently mountainous
and rugged, was accessible to boats on all sides, and was
in fact composed of distinct islands.</p>

<p>The question of the intentions of the Chinese was soon decided;
for the fort on Wantung, as the boat passed between it and the
mainland, on that side, fired at it with round shot. There was
no mistaking the tone of defiance which this indicated; but
Captain Hall was sufficiently acquainted with the Chinese
character to be reluctant to turn back at this threat, because the
affair would have been reported as a great victory, with their
usual exaggeration. The little bow-gun of the boat was therefore
instantly fired at the troops who were looking over the battlements
of the fort; and no further molestation being attempted
by the Chinese, she again pursued her way, content with this
token of defiance.</p>

<p>These little reconnoitring excursions sufficed to shew, were
anything still wanting to bring conviction to the most unbelieving,
that the Chinese were fully aware that no treaty of peace was
likely to be signed, and that they looked forward to the resumption
of hostilities, not only without much apprehension, but
with tolerable confidence in the probability of their own success.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 18th, the four days agreed on for the
return of the messenger from Canton having fully expired, the
Nemesis was moved up from Chuenpee to the Bogue, where she
remained one hour, waiting for an answer from the imperial
commissioner. None, however, was brought; and as everything
now so plainly indicated that cannon-balls alone were to be expected
as a reply, Captain Hall resolved to return to Macao, and
report all that had been seen and done to the plenipotentiary and
the commander-in-chief. Not a moment was lost in communicating
the results of the reconnoitring excursions, the firing of a
shot from North Wantung, and the non-appearance of the
messenger at the appointed time.</p>

<p>The most incredulous now no longer doubted; the film was
raised even from before the eyes of Captain Elliot himself, and
orders were given that all the officers should join their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ships. The light division, which was then in the roads of Macao,
or at the mouth of the river, was placed under the orders of
Captain Herbert (since made K.C.B.) of the Calliope, and was
directed to proceed immediately to the Bogue. It consisted of
the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, Alligator, Sulphur, and the
Nemesis; and the object was "to prevent, as much as possible,
any further defensive preparations on the part of the enemy, but
not to run any unnecessary hazard until the main body of the
force came up." At the same time, the commodore hastened
over to Hong-Kong, in the Madagascar steamer, for the purpose
of taking up the ships of the line, consisting of the Wellesley,
Blenheim, and Melville, seventy-fours, and the steamers, Queen
and Madagascar; leaving the Druid, with the Jupiter troop-ship,
and the transports, Sophia, Minerva, Thetis, and Eagle, to
follow.</p>

<p>These active measures were briefly announced by Captain
Elliot, in a circular issued on the same day to the following
effect, simply stating that "circumstances had induced the commander-in-chief
to announce to H.M. plenipotentiary his intention
to move the forces towards the Bocca Tigris,"&mdash;from which
it would seem that the responsibility of this inevitable measure
was rather assumed by Sir Gordon Bremer than by the plenipotentiary;
but Captain Elliot had also written to Captain Herbert,
stating that he left him at liberty, and <i>moved</i> to prevent the
continuance of defensive preparations at the Bogue.</p>

<p>It was on the day following this movement (the 20th) that
Keshen's notification of his unwillingness to continue negotiations
became known at Macao; and shortly afterwards, the emperor's
edict (before alluded to) was also promulgated, in which
every proposed measure of conciliation towards the foreigners was
recalled, and orders given, on the other hand, that "they should
be rooted out entirely."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st, a reconnoitring party landed, unperceived,
upon the island of Wantung, consisting of Captains
Elliot, Herbert, and Belcher, and Lieutenant Stransham, and
they were able to count seventeen more guns, newly-mounted,
in addition to those which had been observed on the former
occasion.</p>

<p>The truce had already fully expired, but hostilities did not
commence immediately, as might have been expected. On the
22nd, a Chinese boat happened to be stopped, in which was
found a messenger, who was recognised by Lieutenant Watson
as an active agent of the Chinese authorities. It was naturally
suspected that he was the bearer of orders of some kind or other
to the local officers, and such was found to be the case. They
were addressed to Admiral Kwan, desiring him to hurry on the
stopping-up of the channel which runs at the back of Anunghoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
by which the latter becomes an island. The means employed
were stones and stakes, and sunken junks, which had been collected
in large quantities at a place called Sanmannkow, which
must have been the large town known to lie in the rear of
Anunghoy. Thus all our observations respecting the intentions
of the authorities were fully confirmed, and it could now no longer
be doubted, on our part, that a heavy blow must at once be
struck.</p>

or religions monuments as upon the banks of this fine river. This is not the place to
describe them minutely, or to discuss their purpose. They are found in most of the
large towns, and sometimes on the banks of rivers, and form a part of the religious
buildings of the Budhist superstition, and together with it, seem to have been originally
introduced from the west. The shape of them is familiar to most readers. The finest
and most celebrated one of the kind is the famous Porcelain Tower of Nankin; which
is in reality a pagoda, larger and more ornamented than the rest, and distinguished by
being principally constructed of Porcelain brick glazed, and of various shades of colour.
These towers, or pagodas, are of great use in the navigation of the Canton river, as,
from their height, they are conspicuous objects at a distance, and are generally placed
in advantageous positions.</p></div>

a small room or van, placed upon a very sharp-pointed but broad boat, as they are only
used for pulling about the smooth waters of the river. Nothing can be better adapted
to comfort, affording shelter both from the sun and rain, with plenty of room for at least
half-a-dozen people to sit down and converse. The outside of these boats is showily
painted, and commonly decorated with handsome wood-work. The inside is generally
elegantly fitted up. They are usually pulled by four men forward, who use a short
broad-bladed oar or paddle, with great dexterity and effect; and they are also assisted as
well as steered by a large heavy scull-oar behind.</p></div></div>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Keshen, who had spent all his life either in large provincial
capitals or in the imperial city itself, could have had little opportunity
of learning anything either relating to foreign trade or
foreign ships, still less was he acquainted with the "outer waters"
along the coast of the empire.</p>

<p>After describing them to his imperial master, he boldly
ventures his opinion, that the reputation of the fortifications of
the Bocca Tigris, as a place of defence, have been much overrated,
and he goes on to say&mdash;"It is, then, clear that we have
no defences worthy to be called such. It is, in truth, the local
character of the country, that there is no important point of
defence by which the whole may be maintained."</p>

<p>No wonder that such a declaration from a man who was also
the third member of the imperial cabinet, taken, as it was, from
personal observation, should have sounded unpalatable and
even traitorous to the emperor's ear. But this was not all.
Indeed, one might almost imagine that some European must
have pointed out to him defects which his own unpractised and
unaided eye could never have detected.</p>

<p>Lin, on the other hand, had never dared to report to his
master the full extent of the information which was given to him,
though he was fully prepared to adopt every advice which tended
to obstruct the commerce of England, and impede an amicable
settlement of the difficulties.</p>

<p>Such truths are always hard to bear, and harder to believe,
and were consequently <i>not</i> believed, <i>because</i> they were true.
But Keshen did his best to improve his weapons; he sent for a
founder of cannon, who gave him a new model, and undertook
to make some experimental pieces. Yet it did not escape
Keshen that, even if he succeeded in casting good cannon, he
could only do so as a preparation <i>for the future</i>. "They could
not be ready," says he, "for the business we have now in hand.
These are the proofs," he adds, "of the inefficiency of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
military armament, which is such <i>that no reliance can be placed
upon it</i>."</p>

<p>He proceeded to say that it would be necessary to employ a
naval as well as a land force to defend the Bogue, but then threw
out a suspicion that the seamen were not to be depended on, for
that "he had heard a report that, after the battle of Chuenpee,
these men all went to their commander, or Tetuh, and demanded
money of him, threatening that they would otherwise disperse;
and he had, therefore, personally made inquiry into the matter,
and found that the report was perfectly true, and, moreover, that
the Tetuh, having no other remedy, (evidently the pay was in
arrear,) was obliged to <i>pawn his own clothes and other things</i>, by
which means he was enabled to give each of them a bonus of two
dollars, and thus only could he get them to remain for a time at
their posts."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, he added, "our ships of war are not large and
strong, and it is difficult to mount heavy guns upon them.
Hence it is evident that our force here, (he was writing at the
Bogue,) as a guard and defence against the foreigners, is insufficient."</p>

<p>Keshen next remarked upon the character of the people
of the province. "Your slave has found them ungrateful and
avaricious. Of those who are actual traitors it is unnecessary to
say anything. But the rest are accustomed to see the foreigners
day by day, and intimacy has grown up between them." And he
proceeds to contrast them very unfavourably with the people of
Chusan, "who felt at once that the foreigners were of <i>another
race</i>."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Keshen then appealed to the history of the past, and made
particular allusion to the difficulty which had formerly been experienced,
in overcoming even the pirates upon the coast, who
were at length only reduced to submission by a promise of
security upon condition of laying down their arms.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Finally he
expressed great fear, that if he gave battle, he would be unable
to command a victory, and, in that case, the dignity of the
empire would be sullied, and the lives of the people sacrificed.</p>

<p>To understand the full importance of these remarks, it is
necessary to bear in mind that they were written before the
action of the Bogue took place, and as a ground for asking for
the emperor's consent to the terms proposed by Captain Elliot.
Others, however, were called to aid in his councils at this
time, and, among the high officers of Canton, Lin himself was
consulted. They appeared to concur with Keshen; at all events,
they knew that upon his head would rest all the responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The memorial containing Captain Elliot's demands was sent
up to Pekin, together with this report, which was founded upon
personal observation; and Keshen implored the emperor to look
with pity upon "his black-haired flock, the people, and that he
would be graciously pleased to accede to the requests made by
the foreigners, and to grant them favours beyond measure.
Thus," he added, "shall we lay the foundation for victory hereafter,
by binding and curbing the foreigners now, while we <i>prepare</i>
the means of cutting them off at some future period."</p>

<p>Keshen was a true Chinaman of the new school, (for there
are new schools even in antique China,) and, in most respects,
the very opposite of Lin. Sensible of the weakness of his
country when matched with England, conscious of his inability
to fight his enemy with success, he nevertheless hazarded the
chance, when the <i>commands</i> of the emperor compelled him to
aim the blow. He, however, did his utmost to gain time, and
even endeavoured to impose upon Captain Elliot, and to hope
against hope itself. After all that Keshen had said, the defence
of the Bogue was conducted, as we shall now perceive, with more
energy than might have been expected, and, indeed, with considerable
spirit.</p>

<p>On the following morning, at dawn, the Nemesis took Captain
Elliot once more up to the Bogue, where he remained about an
hour, as if in anxious expectation of some communication from
the shore. But this last lingering hope was again deceived.
Captain Elliot, being now fully satisfied that no peaceable communication
from the Chinese was any longer to be expected,
finally left the Bogue, and finding H.M.S. Herald at anchor off
Lankeet, just below Chuenpee, he went on board that vessel,
leaving the Nemesis to pursue her way down to Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, Captain Herbert, with the light squadron, took
up his position at the anchorage off South Wantung, where
Captain Elliot announced to him that Keshen had failed to conclude
the treaty, and that he was therefore to consider himself
moved, to prevent the continuance of the defensive preparations.
The Nemesis having joined him from Hong-Kong on the 23rd,
Captain Herbert embarked on board that vessel, and, taking with
him the pinnaces of the Calliope, Samarang, Herald, and
Alligator, commanded by Lieutenants Watson, Bower, Dewes,
and Woolcomb, proceeded up Anson's Bay to explore the river
before described as opening at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>It was reported that the Chinese were staking it across;
and, from the bustle which had been previously observed there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
when the boat of the Nemesis ventured into it, there was reason
to believe that hostile preparations were being made. Moreover,
it was thought advisable, if possible, to examine the channel
which had been found to lead round in the rear of Anunghoy;
for upon this fortress, as the most extensive of the defences of
the Bogue, it was thought the principal attack of the squadron
would be made. Suspicion was also excited by the contents of
the intercepted despatch of Keshen to Admiral Kwan.</p>

<p>On entering the river, it was no longer to be doubted that
preparations for defence had been commenced. A great number
of boats were observed busily employed in driving stakes or
piles into the bed of the river, across which others were trying
to moor a strong raft. No sooner was the steamer discovered
approaching, than the boats all pulled away, and the Chinese
were seen scampering off as fast as possible. However, when it
came to the point of pulling up the stakes, in order to make a
passage between them for the boats which were in tow, all on a
sudden a heavy discharge from a masked battery, close abreast of
the spot, was poured upon them, and at once betrayed the cause
of the secret preparations before observed.</p>

<p>The steamer immediately poured in a volley of grape and
canister from her bow and stern guns, while the boats pulled
away towards the shore, to carry the works by storm, opening
their fire from their bow-guns as they advanced. The Chinese
fled, after some resistance; and the battery, which was of very
recent construction, was at once taken possession of by the crews
of the boats, the colours being taken by Lieutenant Bowers. It
was found to mount twenty guns of various calibre, which were
immediately destroyed. There were also lying on the ground a
vast number of guns dismounted, probably not less than sixty,
which appeared to have been landed out of their junks, or recovered
after the destruction of their fleet in the bay. These
were all rendered useless, with the exception of a few brass ones,
which were carried away as trophies. Their magazines and
buildings were also totally destroyed. The number of killed
among the Chinese were about thirty, but no wounded were
found, as they had probably been carried off by their companions
in arms. On our side no casualties happened.</p>

<p>Content, for the present, with this successful feat, Captain
Herbert returned in the Nemesis, and rejoined the squadron, at
its anchorage, a little to the southward of South Wantung. On
the following morning they all returned to the scene of the
previous exploit, and set about pulling up the piles, to clear a
passage. This time, likewise, they were fired at, but from a
different quarter. The Chinese troops, posted on the hills above,
commenced firing at the working party, but it was soon returned
from the thirty-two-pounders, by which they were speedily dispersed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
A passage having at length been cleared, the Nemesis
steamed up the river for some distance, until she had nearly
reached the large town at the back of Anunghoy; but, as there
appeared to be no further hostile preparations going on, Captain
Herbert thought it better to return and complete the destruction
of the fort, raft, &amp;c., which had been only partially done the day
before; after which they returned to the squadron, which the
commodore himself had now joined, with the three line-of-battle
ships and the Druid.</p>

<p>The next day, the 25th of February, was the great day of preparation
for the combined and resolute attack of all the Bogue
forts. The batteries which were to be reduced were as follows:&mdash;The
geographical positions of the Bogue have already been
described. Beginning from the south end of the promontory of
Anunghoy, which of course you approach first, there were
several strong works along the shore, the ridges on the hill's
side above being also armed with guns wherever they could be
conveniently placed; and upon the top, which was pretty steep,
an entrenched camp had been formed, calculated for about
twelve hundred men. On this side were two considerable sand-batteries,
not long erected, mounting, as was afterwards found,
thirty guns of small calibre.</p>

<p>Proceeding on along the front was the old battery of
Anunghoy, which, in a manner, seemed to have given place to a
new and extremely well built one, partly of granite and partly of
chunam, and reaching down almost to high-water mark. The
rear of this battery, running up the steep hill-side, was enclosed
by a high wall, on which were steps or platforms for firing
musketry.</p>

<p>Continuing our survey of the walls parallel with the passage
through the Bogue, and passing out of the southern fort by its
northern gate, you found a line of steep rocky beach, about two
to three hundred yards long, and unprotected, which led to the
northern Anunghoy fort. Upon this beach was erected a sort of
platform, made of wood, serving merely as a line of communication
between the forts, for the passage of troops. Having
traversed this causeway, you arrive at the northern fort. This
was a less formidable one than its fellow lower down, but still it
presented an extensive line of works. The whole together completely
defended the river front of the promontory of Anunghoy.
The number of guns mounted upon all these works was afterwards
found to be very great, and the long line of embrasures
certainly looked very formidable.</p>

<p>The island of North Wantung, which is opposite to these
forts, was thickly studded with cannon all over. Its eastern side
presented a formidable line of guns, and was considered by the
Chinese to be its most important side of defence, for it fronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Anunghoy, commanding the passage between them; here they
had planted some of their largest guns. An object upon which
they had placed great reliance was the large chain cable which
they had carried across the passage from Anunghoy to a rock
close to Wantung, and which they had secured into the solid
rock on either side, something after the manner of the chains of
a suspension bridge. The rafts which supported it were strongly
moored, and the Chinese had adopted a curious contrivance for
raising or lowering the chain, for the purpose of letting their
own junks pass through, by means of a kind of windlass.</p>

<p>A passage was not forced through this chain and rafts until
after the forts were taken; and the Chinese appeared to forget
that there was another channel round the west side of Wantung,
and that even had that been impassable, we could have sent our
light steamers, rocket-boats, and gun-boats, round the back of
Anunghoy itself. They, moreover, made little calculation of
the great power of the rising and falling of the tide, the weight
and strength of a line-of-battle ship, or the terrific power of her
broadside.</p>

<p>The little island of South Wantung had been unaccountably
left unoccupied by the Chinese; but, in reality, it was within
range, and well commanded by the strong batteries and Hill
Fort upon North Wantung. The oversight rendered their
positions much less tenable, and soon decided the plan of attack
which was adopted by Sir Gordon Bremer. It was as follows:
a battery of two 8-inch iron and one 24-pounder brass howitzers
was to be erected during the night, in a hollow, upon the top of
this little island of South Wantung, which was very favourably
situated for the object required. This battery would not only
greatly annoy the Chinese in the northern island, and probably
shell them out, but also distract their attention from the attack
upon Anunghoy.</p>

<p>The commodore reserved to himself (with the Wellesley, 74,
and Druid, 42) the attack on the south-west batteries of Wantung,
that is, on the side not fronting Anunghoy; while Sir Le Fleming
Senhouse, in the Blenheim, 74, with the Melville, 74, and The
Queen Steamer, together with the rocket-boats of the two ships,
was to attack the batteries of Anunghoy, using his own discretion
as to the best mode for placing them for that purpose. The light
division under Capt. Herbert, consisting of the Calliope, Samarang,
Herald, Alligator, Sulphur, and Modeste, were to direct
their attention to the batteries on the northern and north-western
side of Wantung, and also those facing Anunghoy, and
either to anchor or keep under weigh, according as it might
appear most likely to ensure the object in view. The Madagascar
and Nemesis steamers were to land the troops, but the latter was
more particularly employed to cover the working party, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
were to raise the battery on South Wantung, and also the troops
on shore.</p>

<p>It was not likely that the land forces would have much to do;
but it was directed that detachments of the 26th and 49th regiments,
with the 37th M.N.I. and Bengal volunteers, under the
command of Major Pratt, of the 26th, should be placed on board
the steamers and the transport-boats, together with a few Chinese
boats collected for the purpose, and they were to remain off the
southern end of South Wantung, protected from the fire of the
enemy's guns, until the Chinese should be driven out of the
batteries, when their subsequent movements were to be directed
by signal. The royal marines also, under Capt. Ellis, were to
be held in readiness to land with the troops, and were to be accompanied
by the two 6-pounder field-pieces of the Wellesley
and Druid, with seamen to work and drag them; scaling-ladders
were also to be carried with the force.</p>

<p>Soon after mid-day, on the 25th, the Nemesis took on board a
detachment of one hundred and thirty of the Madras Native
Infantry, for the purpose of assisting the royal artillery, under
Capt. Knowles and Lieut. Spencer, in the erection of the mortar
battery upon the top of South Wantung; and they were accompanied
by Lieut. Johnson and Lieut. Rundall, of the Madras
Engineers, with the same object. On her way across, the guns
of the large Anunghoy Fort opened upon her, and were fired
with tolerable precision, many of them passing quite near her,
but fortunately without doing any damage. On arriving at the
southern end of South Wantung, it was found that Sir Le Fleming
Senhouse, had already arrived in his own boat, together with a
detachment of the Royal and Madras Artillery. The Anunghoy
Battery continued firing, but without effect, and it was not
returned for some time, by the orders of the commodore. However,
as soon as the detachments were landed, Sir Le Fleming
Senhouse himself gave Capt. Hall permission to return the fire.
No time was lost in landing ammunition and warlike implements
upon the island, and parties were busily employed filling sand-bags
preparatory to the erection of the battery above, the whole
working party being perfectly protected from the fire of the
Chinese.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the batteries on North Wantung began to
open on the Nemesis; and, in order that she might get completely
under cover of the island of South Wantung, she was run full in
upon the shore, which was somewhat steep in that part; and
thus she lay literally with her head out of water, and her stern
deep in it, without receiving any injury; her light draught of
water enabled her to approach closer than any other vessel could
have done. In this manner, all the shot of the batteries passed
over her, without doing any mischief. The fire was not returned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
both owing to the position in which she was, and because it could
only have served to point out, in the darkness of the night, the
situation of the working parties upon the island.</p>

<p>At daylight the battery was quite completed, and the Nemesis
was ordered to withdraw; not long after which, the new battery
opened fire in beautiful style, against North Wantung, under the
direction of Capt. Knowles. The rockets were thrown into it
with great effect, and, together with the shells, could be seen to
fall directly within the forts; this was shortly followed by a blaze
of fire, from the burning of the Custom House and other buildings;
soon after which, the outworks and sand-batteries were
abandoned, and the Chinese took refuge principally in the upper
fort. Their loss must have been considerable at all points; and
the panic created by the bursting of the shells and rockets, which
were quite new to them, evidently threw them into great disorder.
It was reported, and there is reason to believe with truth, that
the Chinese officers abandoned the place at the first commencement
of the firing, and ran down to their boats, having locked
the gates behind them, to prevent their own troops from following
their example.</p>

<p>The grand combined attack was to have commenced early in
the morning, and the troops were ordered to be in readiness at
seven o'clock. The morning, however, was perfectly calm; the
sun shone brilliantly, and lighted up the scene of impending
destruction and slaughter, as if it were to be a scene of rejoicing.
Until ten o'clock there was not a breath of air; when, a light
breeze springing up, the Melville and Blenheim, accompanied by
the Queen steamer, got under weigh, attended by three rocket-boats,
the Blenheim being the leading ship. They stood in for
the southern Anunghoy fort, running along towards the Anson's
Bay side of it, in order to be out of range of its guns in front, so
that they could throw in shot and shell upon its flank, without
any risk of receiving injury themselves. The hill of Anunghoy
was crowned with Chinese troops, their numerous silken banners
floating gaily to the now reviving breeze. Some of their guns
were discharged at a great distance; but the fire was kept up
with spirit, though frequently out of range.</p>

<p>Not so, however, our own majestic ships, which slowly glided
up to their positions without wasting a single shot, until, having
anchored with springs on their cables, they could bring their
broadsides to bear. The Blenheim, although the leading ship,
was either carried by the tide, or else slightly touched the ground,
and was soon overtaken by the Melville, which succeeded in
taking up a more advantageous position in very gallant style.
In the meantime, the Queen had commenced throwing shell
into the sand-batteries and other works upon the hill's side;
and, at the same time, the terrific broadsides of the Melville and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the Blenheim opened upon the great battery; the rocket-boats
also did their full share in the work of destruction. The Chinese
could not long withstand these simultaneous attacks.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>At about the same time with the attack on Anunghoy, began
also that upon the batteries on the western and north-western
side of Wantung, partly under the commodore in person, and
partly under Capt. Herbert. The ships<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> waited to receive the
fire of the forts pretty close, and then at once poured in their
iron shower upon the devoted batteries, with destructive effect.
It would have been impossible for any troops to have long
defended the island of Wantung, bristling though it then was
with cannon, against the powerful force arrayed against it. Our
battery of howitzers had been playing upon it for several hours;
and now six or seven men-of-war, including one line-of-battle
ship, the Wellesley, were battering it at the same time. But the
defenders could not run away, being shut in on every side by the
river; and it was perhaps fortunate for them that the Nemesis,
which had already been engaged with the different batteries, was
sent down to fetch the troop-boats from the southern island,
under which they had been sheltered.</p>

<p>The land force was under the command of Major Pratt, of the
Cameronians, who was already well known to the Chinese at
Chuenpee. The detachments of the 26th and 49th were under
Major Johnson, the marines under Capt. Ellis, the 37th M.N.I,
under Capt. Duff, and the Bengal Volunteers under Capt. Mee.</p>

<p>The scene on all sides at this moment was extremely imposing.
The light breeze, which had barely served to bring the ships into
position, had quite died away when the thunder of artillery commenced,
as if it were unwilling to take them back again until
their work was fully done. The heavy, curling smoke, scarcely
broken by an occasional flash, hung gloomily on every side, as if
to veil from sight the scene of destruction which was going on.
For a time the firing ceased, in order to allow the smoke to rise;
and, just at that moment, the troops were hastening towards
Wantung, to take possession of the works, the firing of which
had also ceased. At the same time, Sir Le Fleming Senhouse,
with the marines and a party of blue-jackets, landed, to the
attack of Anunghoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>At half-past one the troops were landed on Wantung by the
Nemesis and Madagascar, assisted by boats. The object was of
course to reach the hill fort as quickly as possible, and had the
Chinese been better acquainted with the rules of European warfare,
they would probably have at once surrendered themselves,
seeing the utter hopelessness of resistance. Probably the fear of
being put to death as prisoners prevented this timely sparing of
blood. Our gallant troops and seamen pushed rapidly up the
ascent over the ruined outworks, and might have suffered severe
loss before they could have taken possession of the upper fort,
had not the Chinese been almost panic-struck, or had they
possessed weapons better calculated for the purpose of defence.
But, instead of surrendering or accepting quarter, they again ran
out of the fort and down the hill, and many of the poor fellows
were shot in their vain attempts to fly, without any possible
means of escape. The greater part of these took refuge in the
lower Custom House fort, where many of them were killed and
wounded before the rest surrendered, which, however, they at
length did, to the number of about one thousand. The prisoners
were soon afterwards taken to the mainland, and set at liberty,
equally astonished as they were rejoiced at our leniency.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, in the meantime, had gone over to Anunghoy,
to render assistance, if required, and there observed the marines
and seamen of the Blenheim and Melville, under Sir Le F. Senhouse,
in the act of taking possession of the forts. It appears
that they landed without much opposition, though they were only
three hundred in number; and not only passed through the
southern fort, driving the Chinese up the hill above, but also
proceeded along the beach towards the northern fort, of which
they also made themselves masters, the Chinese having fled.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts Keshen himself had entertained concerning
the defensibility of the Bogue, he had too much discretion to
communicate them either to his officers or troops. They had
little anticipation of the total defeat which they were soon to
sustain, for they had made rude sketches delineating the entire
destruction of our ships by the terrible fire of their artillery.</p>

<p>The British flag had by this time supplanted that of China
upon all the defences of the Bogue. It was little past two o'clock,
and ample time yet remained to turn the victory to the greatest
possible advantage before the close of the day. The Nemesis
once more crossed over to Wantung, and as she drew so little
water, was enabled to run close in, and make fast to the lower
fort itself. Nothing, however, of a hostile character remained to
be done in this quarter, but there was yet ample room to perform
the more humane duty of assisting the unfortunate Chinese.
Many of these poor fellows were floating about in the water,
clinging in despair to any small piece of wood or bamboo they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
might have the good fortune to find. Many were drowned, as
had before been the case at Chuenpee, but many yet remained to
be saved. Boats were sent out for this purpose, but the Chinese
notions of warfare were of such a barbarous nature, that they
seemed to think the only object of any attempt to save them was
to reserve them for slow torture, mutilation, or death.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The
poor fellows dived their heads under water as the boats approached
them, attempting to drown themselves, and thus escape
falling into our hands. Many were, nevertheless, dragged out,
and carried on board the steamer, where they appeared bewildered
by astonishment more than by fear, when they found that they
were kindly treated. All of them were soon afterwards liberated
without any conditions, and they then appeared thankful for
their escape.</p>

<p>The day was now far advanced, but there still remained a fort
and encampment to be taken possession of on the opposite side
of the river, usually called Little Tycocktow, facing the western
side of Wantung. There was every probability that these would
be carried without resistance, for the Wellesley had already
seriously damaged the fort, by her beautiful firing of shells, in
the morning, and the Modeste had also contributed to silence it.
A party of the Wellesley's marines were embarked in her own
boats, about four o'clock, under Lieut. Maitland, and proceeded
across, in company with the Nemesis, in order to complete the
day's work. A few shots were fired by her as she approached the
fort, but, finding they were not returned, the boats pushed off to
land, including the boats of the Nemesis, with Capt. Hall and
Lieut Pedder. The fort was found abandoned; and having taken
possession of it, they advanced up the hill in the rear with all
speed, as they observed a body of Chinese in disorder, close to
an encampment upon the top of it. However, on the approach
of the little party, they fled into the interior, abandoning their
lines, magazines, &amp;c. These were all set fire to and destroyed,
and the effect of the blaze, which lasted for a considerable time,
becoming more vivid as the night closed in, spread far and wide,
among the distant inhabitants of the country, the general panic
which had already seized their troops. The conflagration extended
itself on all sides, much beyond the original site of the
encampment, and threw its lurid glare over the scene of slaughter
and confusion of the day. Having spiked the guns in the fort,
the boats returned with their crews to their respective ships.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus closed the eventful day of the capture of the famous
Bogue forts, and the total dispersion of their unfortunate defenders.
Had the Chinese been better armed, and more experienced
in the important science of gunnery, the capture of the
forts would have cost us a much greater sacrifice of human life.
On this occasion, so trifling was the latter, that at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, when
Captain Elliot issued his circular announcing the fall of the
batteries of the Bocca Tigris, to her Majesty's forces, he added,
that "no loss on our side had been reported up to that hour."
Sir Gordon Bremer had only subsequently to report, that "<i>five
men</i> were slightly wounded, throughout the whole force." Much
surprise, however, was created by this announcement, for the
firing was for some time kept up with spirit from the forts. It
was also recorded with the utmost minuteness, "that the main-topmast
and fore-yard of the Blenheim were shot through, one
gun was rendered unserviceable, and there were several shots in
the hull; that the Melville had also a shot in one of her top-masts;
that the Calliope was struck; and that other ships had
just a rope cut here and there." No one could dispute the
triumphant declaration of the commander-in-chief, that he was
"convinced that almost any number of men the Chinese could
collect, would not be able to stand against the animated gallantry
of his men for an instant."</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the loss on the side of the Chinese,
in killed and wounded, should have been so considerable.
Thirteen hundred prisoners were taken, but were set at liberty
soon afterwards; and, altogether, upwards of five hundred were
killed and wounded during the day. Many of the Chinese
officers boldly and nobly met their death, some even courted it;
they dreaded their master's wrath and their own degradation
more than the loss of life at the hands of their country's foe.
Among these, the most distinguished and most lamented, was
poor old Admiral Kwan, whose death excited much sympathy
throughout the force; he fell by a bayonet wound in his breast,
as he was meeting his enemy at the gate of Anunghoy, yielding
up his brave spirit willingly to a soldier's death, when his life
could only be preserved with the certainty of degradation. He
was altogether a fine specimen of a gallant soldier, unwilling to
yield when summoned to surrender, because to yield would imply
treason.</p>

<p>Kwan's body was claimed and recognised by his own family the
following day, and was of course readily given up to them. A
salute of minute-guns was fired to his honour from the Blenheim,
as a brave but fallen enemy. It will be remembered that he was
the same distinguished personage who lost his red button or ball
during the engagement with the war-junks in Anson's Bay, and
obtained it back again, at his own request, through Capt. Elliot's
intercession.</p>

<p>The resistance which the Chinese <i>might</i> have offered to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
forces will be seen from the following account of the ordnance
captured during the day. On the southern Anunghoy fort, were
107 guns, of various calibre; one being a 68-pounder, one a 42,
and a good many of 32, 24, and 18. Four of them were very
large brass guns, made by the Portuguese, in 1627, two of these
being upwards of eleven feet long, and ten inches and three-quarters
in diameter of the bore; three of the iron ones were of
English manufacture, and the remainder were heavy Chinese
guns. On the northern Anunghoy fort were 40 guns, about half
of them varying from 18 to 42-pounders. All of these were
Chinese. At the two sand-bag batteries, erected to the eastward
of the southern fort, were about 30 guns of small calibre; so
that there were altogether on that side of the river one hundred
and seventy-seven guns. Again, upon the little fortified island of
North Wantung, were planted upwards of one hundred and sixty
guns, of which, however, one third were very small, and of little
service; and another third of them varied only from six to twelve
pounders. The remainder were mostly very good, and some very
heavy guns; one being a 68, and another a 42-pounder. Several
of these bore a curious inscription, similar to some others subsequently
taken on Lord Napier's fort, near Canton.</p>

<p>On the fort and works, on the mainland, on the western side
of the river, facing Wantung, were also mounted about forty
guns. Thus, the whole number captured in this day's operations
amounted to three hundred and eighty pieces of cannon; to
which, if we add eighty pieces more, captured on the preceding
day by the Nemesis and boats, under Capt. Herbert, at the masked
battery and stockades in the river, at the bottom of Anson's Bay,
we shall find the whole number taken and destroyed in these two
days alone, at the first resumption of hostilities, to have amounted
to four hundred and sixty pieces.</p>

<p>Immediately after the British flag was planted triumphantly
upon the forts of the Bogue, or at any rate before the close of
the day, a notice was issued by Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer,
by which the blockade of the river of Canton was raised. British
and foreign merchant-ships were now permitted to proceed as far
as the Bogue, and were to be allowed to go further up the river,
as soon as the obstructions to the navigation could be removed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>The great event which has now been described, the capture of
the Bogue forts, though purchased at a very small sacrifice on
the part of the victors, derived an immense importance from the
greatness of the sacrifice in reference to the Chinese. Although
the cautious discernment of a few men like Keshen might have
appreciated the strength of their enemy, and the comparative
weakness of their own defences, the fact of the fall of the Bogue
forts, which were considered by the Chinese throughout the
empire, as well as by the government, to be impregnable, created
a degree of alarm in the public mind without parallel since the
Tartar conquest. Whatever reliance the authorities on the spot,
and the overweening arrogance of a population accustomed
only to the "submission" of foreigners, may have placed in the
efficiency of other recent preparations of a different description
higher up the river, these could never inspire confidence in the
mass of the nation, or even in the government, to whom the
nature of them could be little known.</p>

<p>The fall of the Bocca Tigris at once destroyed the charm of its
supposed strength, and the loss of a feudal tower of old could
hardly have spread more consternation among a host of vassals,
than did the fall of the Bogue forts among the Chinese nation.
Totally inexperienced in the horrors of war, they retained a sort
of hereditary pride in the Bogue, as their great bulwark against
the inroads of the foreigner. The whole nation was at that time
unprepared for war, and the government without any organized
system of defence. Hence it is not difficult to perceive, that
advantage might have been taken of their momentary state of
alarm, to have urged them at once to the conclusion of some
kind of peaceable settlement. The whole difficulty, however, at
that time, seems to have turned upon the question of the supply
of tea. The Chinese saw clearly the anxiety which we shewed to
obtain the year's crop, and they quickly boasted that "their tea
and their rhubarb were as necessary to the foreigner as air itself."
However, it was resolved at length, that we should dictate the
terms of peace at Canton, rather than at the Bogue, and,
accordingly, the fleet prepared to proceed immediately up the
river.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that a large chain cable had been thrown
across the river, supported by rafts, between Anunghoy and a
little islet close to South Wantung. It served them no good
purpose whatever; and after the ports were taken possession of,
nothing was easier than to remove this impediment to the navigation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
The forts were next blown up, or damaged as much as
they could be, though not without great labour and difficulty,
arising from the heavy masses of stone and chunam of which
they were constructed. Chinese powder was, moreover, used for
the purpose, which, being less strong, though made as nearly as
possible with the same proportions and of the same materials as
our own, but with less care, added somewhat to the difficulty of
the task. Several days were occupied by the engineers, sappers,
and miners, assisted by seamen, in this laborious operation. It
was, however, effectually done at last, scarcely one stone being
left standing upon another.</p>

<p>On the morning following the action, the light squadron under
Captain Herbert was ordered to proceed without delay up the
river, in order to follow up the advantages already gained by the
panic created by the capture of the Bogue. It consisted of the
Calliope, Alligator, Herald, Sulphur, and Modeste, with the Nemesis
and Madagascar steamers. The principal objects and
the general aspect of the river, as far as the second bar, (which
is <i>below</i> the first one,) have been already described, in connexion
with the account of the grand conference between Keshen and
Captain Elliot.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The whole of the neighbouring country on both sides is almost
one continued tract of swampy rice-ground, an additional proof
of the endless water-communications. Above the first bar, the
river becomes more intricate in its navigation, having its channel
broken and divided by several islands, and ceasing to be navigable
for vessels even of moderate size beyond Whampoa, at
least by any channel which had been at that time discovered.
But it will be presently seen that another passage was soon afterwards
found. The anchorage at Whampoa had heretofore been
the resort of all the foreign trading ships, and the surrounding
country at all times presents a very picturesque and refreshing
appearance. The Canton river would seem at various times to have
been subject to a great rise in its waters, and thus, overflowing
the country through which it passes, to have formed for itself
new passages and lines of communication, which in some parts
give it the appearance of dividing itself into numerous distinct
rivers, at other times merely separating its waters for a very short
distance, leaving a few picturesque islands between its branches,
and speedily re-uniting its numerous streamlets again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p>Whampoa is, perhaps, the largest of several islands, which lie
in the main course of the river. It is about four miles in length,
and has a rather shallow channel on either side, navigable only
for vessels of very small draught of water. On its north-eastern
side, quite towards its lower end, lies the much smaller island
called Junk Island, a long narrow strip of land, which with its
shoals greatly impedes the navigation on that side. The channel
between it and Whampoa is generally known by the name of
Junk River.</p>

<p>Nearly all our merchant-ships used to anchor towards the
bottom of Whampoa Island, in what has been called Whampoa
Reach; but smaller ones could proceed up as far as the village
of that name, beyond which the channel has become known by
the name of Fiddler's Reach. Some, however, of our largest
ships were formerly accustomed to take in their outward cargoes
as low down as the "Second Bar," which occasioned an additional
charge for lighters or cargo boats, and other inconveniences;
but these now anchor in what has lately been called the
Blenheim Reach, to the southward of Danes' Island. (See map
and plan of Canton.)</p>

<p>It is not a little remarkable, that the Chinese authorities should
have been able to keep foreigners so long in complete ignorance
of some of the most important branches of their magnificent
river, which for two centuries had witnessed the yearly increase
of foreign commerce. This no doubt was effected by the jealous
orders which were issued to their pilots, who dared not follow
any other than the old prescribed track. Yet it is also remarkable
that, among so many ships which have annually visited the
river, none should have been found whose commanders were led
by curiosity, or stimulated by the tiresome sameness of an everyday
life during the dull season, to explore in open boats some
of those large and tempting passages, the openings of which
could be seen. Had not the war stimulated our exertions, or
awakened our curiosity, we should, without doubt, have remained
as ignorant as ever of the capabilities of the river, the extent of
which was scarcely even surmised.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>No wonder that smuggling in every form has been long carried
on to such a notorious extent by the Chinese at Whampoa, and
in other parts of the river. The communications by water from
one point to another, and with the interior of the country, are so
numerous, and so interwoven with each other, that it would be
impossible for any system of fiscal regulations which the Chinese
could adopt to act efficiently against the complicated machinery
of evasion which could so easily be put in operation. This,
among other reasons, may have contributed (always secondary,
however, to their jealousy of foreigners) to the strictness of their
orders respecting the anchorage for our ships.</p>

<p>The light squadron proceeded up the river early on the morning
of the 27th of February. It was not yet perfectly ascertained
what obstacles were to be met with, although it was well known
that the Chinese had been making extensive preparations to impede
the advance of our forces. The wind was light throughout
the day, and the Sulphur, which was to have been the leading
vessel, fell behind; the Nemesis, therefore, now took the lead,
and proceeded with caution, giving the soundings by signal to
the squadron, by means of flags fastened to the ends of long
bamboos; by which contrivance the signals could be made with
the greatest rapidity.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>No new defences or hostile preparations on the part of the
enemy were discovered, until the squadron had passed up a considerable
distance beyond the second bar shoals. The Nemesis
being still ahead, it could now be made out distinctly with the
telescope that a large ship, probably the Cambridge, (a late
British ship, purchased by the Chinese,) was at anchor near the
first bar. This was immediately signalized to the squadron,
which came to anchor about three miles from the position indicated;
but the Nemesis, having previously taken the plenipotentiary
and Captain Herbert on board, proceeded to reconnoitre,
and to ascertain if a clear passage existed for the ships, as the
channel was supposed to have been partially obstructed by
sunken junks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<p>On arriving sufficiently near to observe accurately the dispositions
of the enemy, it was discovered that a considerable mud
battery had been constructed on the left bank of the river (the
right in ascending) above the first bar, near the Brunswick rock,
below Whampoa; and that in order to obstruct the advance of
the squadron beyond it, a very strong and broad raft, formed by
large masses of timber secured well together, had been carried
quite across the river, from one side to the other, precisely opposite
the battery. Behind the raft lay the ship Cambridge,
(previously known as the Chesapeake,) with an admiral's flag at
the main, moored head and stern in such a way that only her
bow guns could be brought to bear for the defence of the raft.
A number of war-junks were also under weigh not far from her.
It was evident that the Chinese were quite prepared for resistance;
and, had the Cambridge been anchored with springs on
her cable, so as to enable them to bring her broadsides to bear
alternately upon the raft, she might have fired with very great
effect upon any of our ships as they approached. But the
Chinese are not sufficiently acquainted with naval tactics to be
able to make the best use even of the resources at their command.</p>

<p>The war-junks looked much more formidable in the distance
than when more nearly viewed, and there was much more probability
of their making their escape after the first shots were fired,
than that they would offer any serious opposition. The fort
itself consisted of a strong line of mud batteries along the river
front, and was afterwards found to mount no less than forty-seven
guns, which were principally intended to protect the raft.
On the left flank of the battery were also mounted several guns,
which bore directly upon the ships as they advanced up the
river; and beyond this, further on the flank, was a small battery
or field-work, mounting four or five guns, and connected with
the former by an embankment, with a small ditch before it, upon
which were planted a great number of ginjals, or wall-pieces.
These latter, from being more easily managed, and more accurately
pointed, were often calculated to do more injury than the
great guns.</p>

<p>Within the fort, or line of field-works, was a double Chinese
encampment, containing about two thousand men. The rear of
the position was protected by a deep creek twenty-five yards
wide, and by paddy-fields, which were partially flooded. These
impediments proved very injurious to the Chinese themselves,
when they were driven out of the fort, and attempted to escape
in the rear; and they suffered great loss there in consequence.
It must not be forgotten that the Cambridge was heavily armed,
although she proved of no service whatever to her new masters.</p>

<p>It was determined that no time should be lost in commencing
the attack on this formidable line of defence, without even waiting
for the arrival of the other ships of the squadron. However,
Captain Herbert immediately went down in his own gig, to bring
up the rest of the force under his orders. Captain Elliot remained
on board the Nemesis, and on this and all other occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
exposed himself with a true sailor's courage, during the hottest
part of the engagement.</p>

<p>An excellent position was taken up by this vessel, not more
than seven hundred yards from the lower angle of the fort, and
having anchored with springs on her cable, she commenced
throwing shot, shell, and rockets single-handed into the fort and
camp, and also at the Cambridge behind the raft. The guns
were plied with great precision, principally under the direction
of Mr. Crouch and Mr. Strangways, mates, R.N.</p>

<p>It was now little more than half-past one, and at two o'clock
the Madagascar took up a position a little outside of the
Nemesis, and commenced firing at the Cambridge with her
24-pounders. The Chinese kept up their fire from as many
guns as they could bring to bear, and from numerous large ginjals,
with considerable spirit. The Nemesis was struck several
times, but fortunately only one man was wounded. One of the
large shot passed completely through the outer casing of the
steam-chest, from one side to the other, and was very near penetrating
the steam-chest itself, which would have been one of the
most serious accidents which could possibly befal her. The
fire of the Chinese was so well sustained for some time, that
repeated persuasion was tried, but in vain, to induce Capt. Elliot
(who was standing as a spectator during the whole time upon
the bridge between the paddle-boxes) to retire from such an
exposed situation.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, having afterwards changed her position, got
aground by running too close in shore, in order to get as near
as possible to the battery, and became so much exposed, that
besides receiving several shot in her hull, she had her spars and
rigging a good deal cut up.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the remainder of the squadron had arrived,
the Sulphur being the first vessel which anchored and commenced
firing; the other ships, however, came up in close succession,
and fired their broadsides with great effect upon the
batteries, the Cambridge, and the war-junks. The vessels engaged
were the Calliope, Alligator, Herald, Modeste, and Sulphur,
with the Nemesis and Madagascar steamers.</p>

<p>The Chinese, who had been already staggered by the smart
fire of the steamers, were now completely bewildered by the
additional attack of the other vessels. Their fire speedily slackened;
and at about half-past three the boats of the squadron,
with the marines under Lieut. Stransham, and a party of seamen
under their respective officers, put off to land and storm the
works, the whole under the able direction of Capt. Herbert.
Those of the Nemesis being nearest in shore, had the advantage
in landing first. All the best men on board, including some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
her engineers, had volunteered for the occasion, and the whole
force now formed together, and immediately dashed on to the
gate leading into the fort close upon the shore. The Chinese
attempted to defend it, but it was forced, although several of the
Chinese officers fought with determined bravery, but little
science. Their troops retreated in disorder, and the British
flag was planted upon the fort by Capt. Hall himself, who as
usual headed his own party.</p>

<p>On this occasion one of the Chinese officers, with cool determination
and a steady aim, deliberately discharged four <i>arrows</i>
from his bow at Capt. Hall, fortunately without effect. Had
they been musket-balls, however, he could scarcely have escaped.
A marine instantly raised his musket at the less fortunate
Chinese officer: the aim was unerring, and he fell. An attempt
was first made to save him for his coolness and courage; but in
the heat of an engagement it is impossible to control every man,
nor is it probable that the officer would have allowed himself to
be taken prisoner.</p>

<p>About four o'clock the fort was completely in our possession,
the Chinese having in vain attempted to stand against the hot
fire of our musketry. They scrambled out at the rear of the fort
in the best way they could, and there suffered severe loss. In
fact they were caught as it were in a trap; for the deep creek
and flooded paddy-fields in a great measure prevented their flight,
so that about a hundred of them were killed or drowned at that
spot, although every effort was made to save them. Some of
them tried to escape across the river, jumping into the water
merely with pieces of wood or small logs in their hands, which
they picked up as chance threw them in their way, in the hope
that these would be sufficient to support them in the water.</p>

<p>While the principal part of our force was thus driving out the
Chinese on one side of the fort, another and smaller party, consisting
of volunteers from the Nemesis and Calliope, were hastening
on towards the gate at the opposite end, at the extremity
of the river-front of the fort, the Chinese retreating before them.
Close by the gate stood a house, in which many of them took
refuge; but finding that there was no hope of escape, and that
resistance would be useless, they immediately surrendered.</p>

<p>The great object now to be attained was to board the Cambridge,
which was lying abreast of the fort. Unfortunately no
Chinese boat was to be found along the shore, and it was quite
tantalizing for the moment to see a prize so near without the
means of reaching her.</p>

<p>At this juncture Lieut. Watson, first-lieutenant of the Calliope,
gallantly succeeded in dragging one of his boats across the rafts,
and launched her on the other side. He then took on board
some of the little party on shore, who seeing a body of Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
crowding upon the deck of the Cambridge, had continued firing
upon them. The boat instantly pulled off to the Cambridge,
under the command of Lieut. Watson, having with him Mr.
Browne, the master of the Calliope, Capt. Hall, and Mr. Galbraith,
of the Nemesis, together with Mr. St. Leger, and about
nine or ten men.</p>

<p>The Chinese were so alarmed at the sudden attack upon all
their defences at once, and at the capture of the fort, as well as
at the loss they had already sustained on board, that they offered
little or no resistance; most of them jumped overboard on the
starboard side as the boarding party climbed up on the port
side.</p>

<p>Many of the Chinese must have been drowned in attempting
to swim on shore, as there were no boats at hand to pick them
up, and their own redoubtable war-junks had already made the
best of their way up the river, for fear of meeting the same fate
as the Cambridge. A number of dead and wounded were found
upon the decks, strong evidence of the well-directed shot of our
ships. She mounted altogether thirty-four guns of English
manufacture; and it was rather surprising to see how well the
Chinese had prepared for action, the guns being in perfect order,
fire-buckets distributed about the decks, and everything very
clean and well-arranged.</p>

<p>It now became a question whether she was to be blown up or
retained as a prize; but it was decided by Captain Herbert, that
she should be set on fire and destroyed, principally with a view
to strike terror into the Chinese, far and wide, by the explosion;
and partly, also, because she was an old and useless ship. Preparations,
therefore, were at once made by Lieutenant Watson,
with this object. The wounded were all carried on shore, and
every part of the ship was searched with great care, to ascertain
that there were not any Chinamen remaining concealed. The
few stores found on board were of very little value, and at five
o'clock she was set on fire.</p>

<p>Slowly the flames spread throughout the ship, gradually bursting
out of every port; little more than an hour sufficed for the
fire to reach the magazine, and then she suddenly blew up,
rending the atmosphere, and making every object around her
tremble with the explosion. The sparks of fire and burning
timbers were thrown far and wide in every direction; and, as it
was by this time dark, they served to spread the alarming intelligence
even among those who were scarcely near enough to hear
the explosion. Several houses took fire at a considerable distance
from the spot, by the falling of the burning fragments
which were carried through the air. The lower part of the hull
of the Cambridge went down in deep water.</p>

<p>Thus ended the tragedy of the day; and, following as it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
only twenty-four hours after the capture of the Bogue, and at the
distance of only a few miles from Canton, we can easily imagine
how completely it must have paralysed for the moment all the
little remaining spirit and energy of the Chinese. The city of
Canton would probably have fallen an easy prey, had our successes
been followed up by a bold dash at it. But the different
approaches by which our forces could advance were then very
imperfectly known, otherwise the smallness of our numbers
would in any case have been amply compensated by the panic of
the moment.</p>

<p>Throughout the operations of the day, Captain Elliot had distinguished
himself by his personal courage, and landed with the
party from the Nemesis to storm the fort. The loss of the
Chinese is believed to have amounted to about three hundred
killed and wounded. On our own side there were eight or nine
men wounded and one killed. The magazine of the fort, and
the guns, about sixty in number, were destroyed or rendered
useless. Those of the Cambridge were blown up with the
vessel.</p>

<p>The great raft across the river was not less than five hundred
and fifty yards long, and is said to have cost the Chinese an immense
sum of money, which was exacted from the Hong merchants.
It was constructed with great strength and solidity, for
upon it they had rested their most confident hopes of successful
resistance. It was cleared away, not without a good deal of
labour, on the following day, and thus the passage was now
opened for the advanced squadron to proceed up to Whampoa.</p>

<p>The Madagascar was sent down to the Bogue, to inform Commodore
Sir Gordon Bremer of what had taken place, while the
boats of the squadron, together with the Sulphur and Nemesis,
pushed on to explore the river higher up&mdash;a reconnoissance being
necessary before the ships could advance, owing to the uncertainty
as to what impediments the Chinese might have formed
to obstruct the navigation.</p>

<p>During the day, the Nemesis and boats got far enough up the
branch on the eastern side of Whampoa, called Junk River, to
catch a view of a little fort at the upper end of Whampoa, called
Howqua's Folly.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It was further ascertained that a large body
of Chinese were collecting in that direction, principally on the
shore opposite the island, and that a double line of stakes, interlaced
with bamboos, were driven across the upper part of
the Junk River passage, where also several large junks appeared
to have been sunk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>It turned out afterwards that, had the Nemesis proceeded
only a hundred yards further on, she would have been lucky
enough to discover a masked battery, which it was reserved
for the boats of the Wellesley, in company with the Sulphur,
to find out on the following day, and to have the honour
of capturing.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sir Gordon Bremer, in consequence of the
important intelligence conveyed to him by the Madagascar,
hastened up from the Bogue the same day, bringing with him
the marines of the Wellesley, together with a hundred seamen,
under Captain Maitland. The marines of the Blenheim, Melville,
and Druid, likewise followed, together with a number of
boats well armed and manned. The Queen steamer also came
up, bringing with her the Eagle transport, and another, the
Sophia, being towed up by the Madagascar.</p>

<p>In the evening, Sir Gordon Bremer, with these seasonable
reinforcements, joined the advanced squadron just as they had
got up to Whampoa Reach. In consequence of the report made
to the commodore of the reconnoissance which had been made
during the day, he was induced to send up the Sulphur on the
following morning, together with three of the boats of the Wellesley,
to pursue the examination further. The boats of the
Wellesley were commanded by Lieutenant Symonds, the first
lieutenant of that ship. It is distinctly stated, in Sir Gordon
Bremer's <i>official despatch</i>, that the Sulphur was towed (going <i>up</i>)
by the boats, and that, as soon as they had got within range of
the masked battery, which had been suspected but not discovered
the day before, the latter opened upon them; upon which,
Lieutenant Symonds, with great decision and gallantry, instantly
cut the tow-rope, and dashed off to storm the fort.</p>

<p>Such is the account published at the time. But in Captain
Belcher's account of the affair, (vol. ii. p. 158,) it is stated that
this was a mistake, and that the Sulphur was not <i>towed</i> at all by
the boats; it is left to be inferred, also, that Lieutenant Symonds
did <i>not</i> cut the tow-rope, or else that, if he had done so, he
would have been guilty of a breach of discipline.</p>

<p>I have no means of judging between these two accounts; but
it was generally understood that Lieutenant Symonds' gallantry
and energy were highly approved of by the commodore, whether
in obedience of orders or otherwise. Captain Belcher further
states that he himself "jumped into his gig to <i>recal</i> the boats,
or to prevent them doing too much, and that it was by Captain
Elliot's wish, who was <i>left in charge during his absence</i>." Still
it appears that the battery was carried by Lieutenant Symonds
and his men, who soon drove the Chinese out of it, killing
several. The official account further states that the Sulphur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
immediately anchored, and sent a few shot in amongst the thick
underwood, in which the Chinese took shelter.</p>

<p>The battery was found to mount about twenty-three guns,
which, together with the magazine, and all the <i>matériel</i>, were
destroyed. The boats were repeatedly struck by grape-shot
as they dashed on shore, but only one man was wounded
mortally.</p>

<p>The Nemesis came up the Reach during the day, and managed
to get within long gun-shot of Howqua's Folly, about two miles
higher up. In the evening, the Alligator, Modeste, and Herald,
joined her, with two transports. The distance from Canton was
now so short, that they must have been within sight of the city,
although there was too little water by the direct passage to
enable them to get up further. The channels by which they
afterwards reached Canton had not as yet been discovered.</p>

<p>Howqua's Fort, or folly, was built of stone, at the mouth of a
little creek, at the extremity of Whampoa Island, and was surrounded
by low paddy-fields, which occasioned its foundation to
be so insecure that it afterwards fell down. It mounted nearly
thirty guns of various calibre. The commandant seems to have
had no particular taste for fighting, and thought a timely retreat
would save him a vast deal of trouble. The fort was accordingly
soon abandoned. A detachment of the 26th Cameronians occupied
it, while a party of marines, under Captain Ellis, took possession
of a large joss-house, or temple, opposite to it, on the other side
of Junk River, where a strong body of the enemy had already been
seen. They strengthened this position against any sudden attack.</p>

<p>Just above these two points, and consequently between
Howqua's and Napier's Folly, which latter was situated upon the
extremity of a low alluvial island, a little above Whampoa, a
strong line of stakes or piles had been driven into the bed of the
river. The next step, therefore, was to clear a passage through
them, which was not to be very easily effected, owing to the
rapidity of the stream, and the stiffness of the soil forming the
river's bed.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture, the prefect of Canton or Kwang-Chow-Foo
came alongside the Nemesis in his barge, attended by a
linguist, and inquired for Captain Elliot, who happened not to
be on board. Upon this the prefect affected to be in a great
hurry to go away, saying that he could not wait for his return.
Captain Hall told him that if he couldn't wait, he had better be
off at once. But he continued, for some time, sitting in his
boat, which was hanging on astern, evidently with forced composure,
for he declined coming on board the steamer.</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Elliot returned, they went down to
Whampoa Reach together, where a conference was held in due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
form. Captain Elliot certainly wished that hostilities should not
be pushed further, if it could be avoided; and, accordingly,
although it was perfectly well known and admitted that Keshen
had been degraded from his office of commissioner, and that his
successor had not yet arrived, a truce was agreed upon for three
days with the Kwang-Chow-Foo. This was a humane and conciliating
piece of leniency on the part of Captain Elliot, for, at
that moment, there was really no responsible public officer who
could undertake on the part of the Chinese to treat for or accept
any terms whatever. At the same time, it was not denied that a
general panic prevailed at Canton, and that vast numbers of
people were leaving the city.</p>

<p>A lull now ensued, the probable result of which it was idle to
guess, although it was generally expected that hostilities would
be resumed, and that no settlement whatever could be attempted,
until Canton itself was completely at our mercy. This happened
precisely at the moment of the arrival of Major-General Sir
Hugh Gough, from Madras, in H.M.S. Cruizer, to assume the
command in chief of all the land-forces, by the orders of the
governor-general of India. This important event happened on
the 2nd March, 1841; and the arrival of a general of acknowledged
bravery and distinction was a subject of much congratulation,
and was looked upon as likely to lead to energetic and
decisive steps.</p>

<p>It was also just about this time that the force which had been
ordered down from Chusan arrived in the Canton River&mdash;namely,
the Pylades, Blonde, Conway, and Nimrod, together with the
transports, conveying the troops. Our forces were, therefore,
now concentrated; and, whatever may be the opinion generally
entertained concerning the policy of so suddenly giving up
Chusan long before the answer could have arrived from Pekin
respecting Keshen's treaty, it happened, nevertheless, very much
to our advantage, that the whole of a still small force was now
united at one point, for the more effective prosecution of any
enterprise which it might be advisable to undertake. Thus it
occurred on many occasions during the war, that what appeared
at first sight unfortunate, or, at all events, little likely to be attended
with good results, turned out, in the end, to be most advantageous.
The addition of these reinforcements from Chusan
enabled us now to dictate terms to the Chinese authorities, which,
without them, it would not have been so easy to exact.</p>

<p>Advantage was taken of the interval of the three days' truce
(which was to expire on the 5th) to explore in the Nemesis, by
the orders of Captain Herbert, one of those broad passages
which were known to turn off to the westward, from Whampoa
Reach. It was thought likely to lead, indirectly, even to Canton,
and might therefore greatly facilitate the advance of our forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
upon the city. It has already been stated, that these channels
had never been properly explored by foreigners; though a passage
of some sort or other was well known to exist on either side of
French and Dane's Islands.</p>

<p>Captain Elliot himself was very anxious upon this subject, and
offered a reward of one hundred dollars to any active fisherman
or pilot who would point out the best channel. It was thought
probable, also, that there were <i>several</i> channels, some, perhaps,
large enough for our sloops, of which we were hitherto perfectly
ignorant.</p>

<p>A pilot soon offered his services, in consideration of the handsome
reward; although there appeared little doubt of the
Nemesis being able to find a passage for herself (drawing so
little water) without any pilot at all.</p>

<p>Soon after nine o'clock, the Nemesis got under weigh, under
the direction of Captain Herbert, having Captain Elliot and other
officers on board. The object was not to make any minute
survey of the passage; but merely to ascertain, by a cursory
examination, the nature of the channel, and in what direction it
was likely to terminate. Leaving Dane's and French Islands to
the southward, they proceeded very cautiously to thread their
way through the shoals or mud-banks which were found in the
passage. The country on both sides was low and swampy, but
the channel was not found blocked up by sunken junks or stones,
as it had been in other parts; probably because the Chinese
hardly expected that any attempt would be made to pass through
it, and partly because the river into which it led (the Broadway
or Macao passage) had been already sufficiently fortified and
obstructed. They passed a deserted battery and one or two small
villages.</p>

<p>In the course of a couple of hours, during which time they
had advanced slowly, with a depth of water from two to three
fathoms, they came in sight of a circular stone fort, with a tower
or pagoda upon it, apparently between two and three miles
distant.</p>

<p>As the truce had not yet expired, it was not thought right to
proceed further for the present; but they had already reached
the point of junction with the Macao passage or Broadway River,
in the middle of which the fort (which was afterwards called the
Macao Fort) was situated. Enough had been ascertained to
serve as a guide for future operations; and the Nemesis, passing
round a small island at the head of the passage, returned the
same way she had come, and rejoined the squadron at Whampoa.
It was through this passage that some of our vessels proceeded,
a few days afterwards, to the attack of the fort, which has been
noticed above.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day, the 6th, the truce expired. But there
was anything but a peaceable disposition shewn on the part of
the Chinese authorities. They issued strict orders that none of
the natives should supply provisions to our ships. The boats
which had hitherto come fearlessly alongside our vessels all on
a sudden disappeared; and it was known at Canton that the
native merchants were compelled to remove all the tea and silk
out of the town.</p>

<p>In consequence of these proceedings, a proclamation was
addressed by Captain Elliot to the people of Canton, telling them
that they were quite at our mercy, and that the city was only
spared "in order to shew how <i>tenderly</i> the good and peaceable
inhabitants were considered" (by the English). But it was
added, that, "if the authorities should continue to prevent the
native merchants from buying and selling with the foreign merchants,
then the whole trade of Canton was to be immediately
stopped, and the city strictly blockaded." It then wound up by
throwing "the whole responsibility of the present state of things
upon the bad advisers of the emperor."</p>

<p>Preparations were now made for an immediate advance upon
the city; and it was a favourite notion of Captain Elliot that he
could blockade all the approaches to Canton, and thus, by cutting
off its immense <i>internal</i> commerce, upon which thousands depend
for their living, and nearly the whole population for its
supplies of food, constrain the authorities to come to some
reasonable terms, without any further necessity for a resort to
arms.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It should be remembered that by the first and second bar are merely meant sand-banks
or flats, which impede the navigation of the river, of course contracting, to a
certain extent, the channel for large ships. The second bar is a large shoal on the left
side of the river, ascending (or geographically on its right bank) upwards of ten miles
above Tiger Island. The pagoda, near which the conference was held, stands near its
upper extremity, on the same bank of the river. The first bar, however, lies about
seven miles higher up on the opposite side of the river, and is not so extensive a flat as
the lower one. It seems to have been formed by a deposit from the waters of one of
the larger of those numerous rivers, or their branches, which empty themselves not
only into the Canton River, but into all the principal rivers of China. Indeed so
numerous are these water communications in every direction, that Keshen was perfectly
correct in his observation that small vessels could proceed wherever they pleased, even
up to Canton itself, without passing through the main river. Of course the channel
becomes both narrower and more intricate in the neighbourhood of the bar; and therefore
the Chinese shewed considerable judgment in attempting to defend this position,
which was in fact the most tenable one between the Bogue and Whampoa; from which
latter place it was distant about four miles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> It is worthy of notice, that not a single ship of the squadron touched the ground
on their passage up, although there was no native pilot on board any of the vessels.
The great advantage of steamers drawing little water in leading a fleet up a river is
undeniable; the certainty and perfect control of their movements, with the facility of
changing their position, or of backing off, should they touch the ground, give them an
immense advantage over every other description of vessel for exploring the passage of a
river.</p></div>

were the Dutch Folly, French Folly, Napier's Folly, and Howqua's Folly. The most

foundation being weakened by the washing of the river.</p></div></div>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Captain Elliot now addressed a request to the naval and
military commanders-in-chief, that they would make no further
movements towards the city until the disposition of the provincial
officers could be put to the test. All the private information
which could be gathered, however, tended to shew that further
delay was likely to be useless, and even prejudicial. As
soon, therefore, as the day for the expiration of the truce had
arrived, the Nemesis was ordered to convey Captain Elliot, with
the commodore and the major-general, together with their
respective suites, up to Howqua's Fort, having the broad pendant
flying; there several other ships of the advanced squadron
were already at anchor. The flag of truce was then lowered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
immediate dispositions were made for the capture of Napier's
Fort, which was a little distance higher up.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>A little below the fort a strong double line of piles had been
driven into the bed of the river, completely across from one bank
to the other. These were strengthened by sunken junks, and
the passage was further blocked up by large stones thrown into
the river, and other impediments. There were flanking batteries
also on either side, recently built of mud, and not quite finished;
they were intended to mount thirty-five and forty-four guns.</p>

<p>These positions were capable of being stoutly defended, had
they been fully armed and manned. Such, however, was not
the case; and, as the commandant of the fort was inclined to exhibit
the same compliant disposition as his gallant companion in
arms had shewn at Howqua's Fort below, no resistance was
offered; in fact, the garrison all ran away as soon as they had
fired off their guns, having previously intimated their intention,
and succeeded in making good their escape.</p>

<p>The Sulphur, accompanied by some of the boats of the
squadron, managed to get up first, and took possession, followed
by the Nemesis, with the commodore on board, and other vessels.
A detachment of troops had been sent round by the general,
with a view to take the flanking-batteries in the rear; but, as it
now appeared that they were undefended, and as the march over
swampy paddy-fields, and across numerous water-courses, was
anything but agreeable, and not likely now to be useful, they
returned to the joss-house below.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the Nemesis proceeded with the commodore
and Captain Elliot down to Whampoa, passing along the western
side of that island, by the channel which was known by the name
of Fiddler's Reach; she had therefore gone completely <i>round</i>
Whampoa Island in the course of the day, for she went up by the
eastern or Junk river side, and came down by the western or
Fiddler's Reach passage, proving the practicability of <i>both</i> channels
for vessels of small draught of water.</p>

<p>It may be well here to notice that, at a subsequent period,
after the fall of Canton, and when the Chinese were prevented by
us from renewing or extending any of the defences of the river
<i>below</i> Whampoa,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> they set about strengthening the positions
above that island with all the resources they could employ.
Before the close of the war, they not only rebuilt Napier's Fort
in a much more substantial manner, but fortified all that line of
the river upon a plan much superior to any they had hitherto
attempted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Three other large stone forts have been built, with a view to
command the navigation of this part of the river; namely, one
on each bank of the river opposite Napier's Fort, and one about
half a mile lower down, at the point where the river is strongly
staked across. Viewed from the river, all these new forts look
extremely formidable, being built entirely of stone, of considerable
height, and calculated to mount little less than <i>two hundred guns</i>.
The structure of all these new works is of a superior kind to any
before seen in China; and it is generally supposed that they
have been built at the suggestion or with the assistance of some
European engineer. But, as usual in China, the rear of the forts
is almost entirely unprotected, except by a stone wall; and, were
it not that the advance of an enemy on that side would be
greatly impeded by ditches and paddy-fields, which would oppose
difficulties to the bringing up of artillery, they could be captured
without any extraordinary effort.</p>

<p>The short pause in our operations, which now again took place
at the request of Captain Elliot, was precisely in accordance with
the liberal assurances of the most <i>pacific</i> intentions on the part
of the Chinese. Their acts, however, by no means agreed with
their words. It was perfectly ascertained that a large number of
fire-vessels were being prepared a few miles above Canton; that
new defences were being constructed around the city, particularly
upon the heights in its rear; and that people were removing
their property from the town, and no valuable produce was
allowed to be brought into it. Sir Gordon Bremer distinctly expressed
his conviction that the measure of attacking Canton
itself must speedily be resorted to; although he deplored the excesses
to which it might give rise, owing to the abandonment of
the city by the authorities, and the absence of control over the
rabble of a community proverbially bad. The major-general
now went down the river, and remained at Wantung with the
commodore, where plans for the future operations were devised.</p>

<p>About this time, Keshen, whose functions had already ceased,
left Canton for Pekin in disgrace, in order to be put upon his
trial for traitorous conduct, as his unfortunate defeats were now
termed. The result was, that he was utterly degraded; all his
property, which was enormously valuable, was confiscated, and
he himself banished to the cold regions of Tartary.</p>

<p>On the 10th, despatches were sent up by the Nemesis from
Captain Elliot (who in the meantime had gone to Macao) to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
commodore at the Bogue, in consequence of the Chinese authorities
having issued chops or passports for all ships, <i>except British</i>,
to proceed up the river to trade, as far as Whampoa. This act
of open defiance could not be overlooked, and Captain Elliot
himself seems to have been struck with the hostile temper which
this proceeding evinced. A notice was, in consequence, issued
to the effect, "that, as the port of Canton, from its entrance to
its extremity, was in the military occupation of her Majesty's
arms, no ships whatever would be permitted to enter the river,
except under the authority of the commander-in-chief; and,
moreover, that a close embargo would be laid on the city and
trade of Canton, until the whole of their foreign trade should be
placed upon a perfectly equal footing, without any exception
whatever."</p>

<p>In point of fact, our previous forbearance had not been understood,
and was certainly looked upon rather as an evidence of
conscious weakness on our part, than as what it actually was&mdash;an
instance of forbearance, resulting from conscious strength.</p>

<p>It was, probably, the necessity which he now felt of striking
some blow calculated to make an immediate impression upon the
Chinese, which induced Captain Elliot to direct his attention to
one of the most boldly-conceived and successfully-executed exploits
which have to be recorded during this campaign. It
appears to have struck him almost on a sudden; and, finding
that Captain Scott, of the Samarang, who was then senior officer
at Macao, and also Captain Hall, of the Nemesis, entirely concurred
with him in his views, it was resolved that not a moment
should be lost. Above all, it was kept perfectly secret; so that
no rumour of any new project could reach any of the inhabitants
of Macao, either Portuguese or Chinese. The undertaking to
which I allude, became afterwards generally known as the forcing
of the Broadway, or Inner, or Macao Passage, (for it has obtained
all these names,) by the Nemesis, accompanied by three
boats&mdash;viz., two belonging to the Samarang, and one to the
Atalanta steamer. This passage leads direct from Macao to
Canton, but had been hitherto frequented only by native boats;
indeed, no others were permitted to pass through it. This was
one of those numerous opportunities in which the Nemesis so
clearly demonstrated the great advantage to be derived from the
employment of shallow iron steamers in hostile operations along
the course of unexplored rivers.</p>

<p>It must here be remarked that this intricate passage was one
never before traversed by any European vessel or boat, and believed
by the Chinese themselves to be inaccessible to foreigners,
both owing to the shallowness and intricacy of its channels, and
to the number and strength of the artificial defences erected on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
its banks. It can, perhaps, be scarcely called a distinct river,
but may be rather considered as in reality one of those almost
innumerable channels which present themselves to view on every
side, along the whole sea-board of China; dividing and then re-uniting,
sometimes receiving large branches, sometimes throwing
them off, here communicating with other rivers, and there even
traversing across them. It is difficult to ascertain, with regard
to many of them, whether they are distinct rivers or branches, or
mere water-courses, leading from one to the other. In short,
with respect more particularly to the country about Canton, the
whole of it appears to be subdivided, again and again, by these
ever-multiplying channels, which form a sort of fluid network,
embracing the soil it nourishes and <i>reproduces</i>. Many of these
are only known, among the Chinese themselves, by those who
depend on them for subsistence; and who, rarely quitting them,
make their boat their floating home.</p>

<p>On leaving the roads of Macao, and proceeding nearly due
west, after passing the town and the entrance to the Inner Harbour
beyond it, you come into a straight but rather shallow
channel, which continues in the same direction along the
southern shore of the island called Twee-Lien-Shan.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Having
reached its western extremity, which is about four miles from
Macao, you very shortly enter the mouth of a river, which is
broad but shallow, and becomes narrower as you proceed up towards
the north-west, by the gradual contraction of its shores.
This is the entrance to the Broadway, or Inner Passage. Several
openings were soon perceived on both sides, probably the mouths
of smaller rivers or creeks, entering the larger channel. The
proper opening of the Inner Passage begins about six miles from
the western point of Twee-Lien-Shan Island, but the narrow part
of it is about four miles further on.</p>

<p>Let us now imagine ourselves just embarked on board the Nemesis
in Macao roads, at three o'clock in the morning on the
13th of March, all the arrangements having been completed the
day before. Already, Captain Elliot and suite are on board; and
Captain Scott, of the Samarang, who commands the force, is
standing on the quarter deck with the other officers, impatient to
start, while the boats of the Samarang, and that of the Atalanta,
are being made fast astern. And we must also not omit to record
that Mr. Johnston, the deputy superintendent of trade, and
also Mr. Morrison and Mr. Thom, the indefatigable interpreters
and secretaries,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the value of whose services throughout the war
it is impossible too highly to appreciate, were also on board
during this expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Having quitted the town of Macao with the utmost quietness,
leaving all the world asleep, and unconscious of any movement,
they soon fell in with a large junk at anchor, which was fortunately
able to furnish a pilot, one of her crew being taken out,
not without reluctance, for that purpose. At first the poor fellow
was very much frightened, but, finding that he was well treated,
well fed, and good pay promised, he soon became reconciled to
his position, and behaved well throughout. During the day he
seemed very little concerned about the firing either of the
steamer or of his own countrymen, and piloted the vessel, as far
as his knowledge extended, up the river very accurately.</p>

<p>The progress was at first slow, owing to the shallowness of the
water, which often did not much exceed <i>five</i> feet, for a vessel of
more than six hundred tons burden! Indeed the pilot himself
maintained that it would be impossible for the vessel to proceed;
and it may be noticed that the soundings at the entrance were
not found so deep as laid down in Horsburgh's chart, in which
they are partially given. However, on she went, nothing
daunted either by mud, sand, or water, or even by the shallowness
of the river.</p>

<p>Day had now long dawned; and at eight o'clock she came in
sight of a fort on the starboard hand, which proved to be situated
on a small promontory on the left bank of the river. It is called
Motow, and is situated some distance below a point where the
main channel separates into two branches. Half an hour afterwards,
the Nemesis was near enough to take up a position to the
southward of the fort, so that she could fire directly into it without
any of the enemy's guns being able to bear upon her; in
fact, she enfiladed the position. Upon this the fort was abandoned
by the Chinese, whose flight was accelerated by their seeing
that the boats were putting off to attack them. The place
was immediately taken possession of, the buildings of every
description set on fire, and the guns, thirteen in number, rendered
unserviceable. The boat's crews were again on board the
Nemesis in about an hour, and she pursued her course without
loss of time.</p>

<p>About four miles further on, just above where the river becomes
more contracted by its division, a second fort was discovered,
also situated on the left bank. The position was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
chosen, upon a rising ground, at some distance from the river
side, but commanding the whole bend or reach of the river in
front of it. It was built of mud, but protected nearly all round
by flooded paddy-grounds.</p>

<p>On this occasion the Chinese were the first to open their fire
upon the Nemesis as she rounded an intervening point of land,
and entered the reach above mentioned. They kept up their
fire at first very smartly, having probably trained all their guns
to bear upon one particular point. It was most effectually returned
by the steamer with shot, shell, and rockets, which were
thrown (as officially reported by Captain Scott himself) with
remarkable accuracy. The boats again put off to land, under
cover of the rising bank on the river side, with the intention of
taking the position in flank; but the Chinese at once abandoned
their works; though, if they had resisted the advance, they
might have inflicted severe loss, as the party could only approach
the fort along a narrow causeway, in single file. The works
were immediately taken possession of, and were found to mount
twelve or fourteen guns, which were of course destroyed, as were
also the sheds and buildings within the fort, which, however,
were of very recent construction, and of a temporary nature.</p>

<p>Before returning to the steamer, the boats pulled across to the
opposite side of the river, where a large chop-house and military
depôt were likewise destroyed. The name of the fort, or field-work,
above described, was Tei-yat-kok.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> At this point several
other Chinamen were taken on board as pilots, for the better
navigation of the channel through which they had now to proceed.</p>

<p>They had ascended a very little way further up the river, when
to the joy of every one, they espied nine war-junks under weigh,
a considerable distance ahead, and chase was given at full speed,
in spite of all obstacles of the navigation. The interest and
excitement momentarily increased, as every mile they advanced
served to lead them to the conclusion that the Chinese were
better prepared for defence than had been at all expected. Indeed,
it was not a little remarkable that a passage never before
explored by foreigners should have been found in a state of preparation
against attack, by forts of old standing and solid construction,
as well as by works of recent and temporary formation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>On entering the bend of the river in which the junks had been
first caught sight of, a considerable stone-built fort was discovered,
called Houchung, or Ha-chap, close to the river's side,
upon its right bank, (on the left hand ascending,) in front of
which, and perfectly commanded by it, piles had been driven
across the river, so as to obstruct the navigation. But the work
had apparently not been quite finished, and a narrow opening
was still left in the centre, through which the junks had already
passed, in order to take up a more secure position, as they
thought, on the other side. The fort mounted fourteen or fifteen
guns. But there was also another and smaller fort close to it,
built of earth, and not yet finished, being without guns, but
having ten embrasures.</p>

<p>Here again the Chinese were the first to begin firing, both
from the fort and junks; but it was returned with precision and
rapidity by the Nemesis, under cover of which the boats pushed
off to storm the fort. This was effected without much difficulty.
The fall of the fort of course left the passage through the stakes
quite unprotected, except by the junks; but the Chinese sailors
were so panic-struck by the rapidity with which the fort had
been taken, and by the approach of the boats, which were now
making their way through the stakes to attack them, that seven
out of the nine were run ashore by their crews,&mdash;when they immediately
jumped overboard and escaped, leaving their vessels
entirely at our mercy.</p>

<p>Just as the boats came up to take possession, a field-work on
the left bank, within little more than a hundred yards of the
headmost junk, opened fire on them unexpectedly with grape-shot.
As the junks were already abandoned, a strong party at
once landed, under Lieut. Bower, and carried the field-work, by
passing round to its rear, which, as usual with the Chinese, was
left almost unprotected. This place, which was called Fie-shu-kok,
was set on fire and destroyed, together with the seven guns
which were mounted on it. The war-junks were likewise set on
fire, and blew up very shortly after. But the two which had not
been run ashore contrived to make good their escape.</p>

<p>During the time that these operations were being effected,
Capt. Hall had dexterously succeeded in getting his steamer
through the stakes by the same opening through which the
junks had passed, and which barely afforded room for her paddle-boxes.
The flood-tide was now running up with great rapidity,
and she was therefore dropped through the passage, being
steadied by kedges and hawsers, two of which they cut away,
and left behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>She now joined the boats opposite Fie-shu-kok; and as soon
as the destruction of the junks and works had been completed,
it was resolved to push on further up the river, in the hope of
overtaking the two junks which had got away. Altogether
twenty-one guns had been destroyed in these forts, and twenty-eight
more in the junks. But the <i>impression</i> made through all
the neighbouring country by these active measures, was far more
important than the mere destruction of a certain number of
guns.</p>

<p>At half-past three they arrived at the large trading town of
Heong-Shan, about five or six miles further up. The river flows
straight through the middle of it, so that they found themselves
unexpectedly in the centre of an important inland town, in
which, if it had been their object, it was easily within their power
to inflict severe injury upon a dense and apparently harmless
population. But it has been mentioned before that much suffering
was spared by the assistance of Mr. Morrison and Mr. Thom.
Capt. Elliot also exerted himself very much to prevent the peasantry
or mere lookers-on from being implicated; and he sometimes
allowed even the armed soldiers to escape, rather than run
the risk of injuring the innocent. The object was to confine
hostilities as much as possible to the servants and property of
the Chinese government, leaving the people uninjured.</p>

<p>The good effect of this policy was soon very evident. The
inhabitants of this populous town appeared to regard with very
little apprehension the approach of the steamer, and seemed
more moved by curiosity and astonishment at her structure and
locomotive power, than alarmed by any dread of her hostile
intentions. The people crowded upon the banks of the river;
the house-tops and the surrounding hills were covered with
curious gazers, wondering what strange event would happen
next. Hundreds of trading junks and boats of various kinds,
most of them the sole home of their owners, were crowded together
on both sides of the river throughout the town, and even
above and below it. The river was narrow, and so densely were
the boats packed, that the only passage left was directly in the
centre of the stream, where, as if by mutual consent, a clear way
had been left, only just broad enough to allow the steamer to
pass, and requiring some dexterity to avoid running foul of the
junks on either side.</p>

<p>It is very curious that so large a body of people should have
looked on with so little apparent fear, particularly as they could
well perceive that the steamer was in chase of two war-junks,
which had preceded her, followed by several mandarin-boats, in
which the mandarins or authorities of the town were endeavouring
to make their escape, in the greatest consternation. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
war-junks, finding that it was impossible to keep ahead of the
steamer, which was rapidly gaining on her, was run ashore, some
distance above the town, by her crew, who immediately jumped
overboard, and had only just time to escape before the steamer
came up. She was at once boarded, and then set fire to and
blown up. She carried four guns. It was now observed that
Chinese soldiers were gathering thickly upon the neighbouring
hills, as if meditating a descent; but a shot or two thrown in
amongst them served to put them to flight.</p>

<p>Just at this moment a masked battery, concealed by some
trees, not more than a couple of hundred yards ahead, imprudently
betrayed itself by opening its fire on the steamer; nor was
this the only instance in which small forts or field-works would
have been passed unseen and uninjured, had they not expended
useless powder in making a smoke, which at once betrayed them.
The fire was instantly returned, and served to cover the boats,
which put off with the marines of the Samarang to storm the
works. Eight guns were found in it, which, together with the
buildings and magazine, were of course destroyed. This place
was called Sheongchap, and was situated just below a point
where the river divides, or rather where two branches unite.</p>

<p>It being now past six, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, it was thought proper to anchor
for the night, after a very severe day's work for all hands since
three in the morning. The Nemesis, having proceeded a little
distance above Sheongchap, found herself getting into very
shallow water, and therefore anchored for the night. The
channel was so narrow that it was impossible to turn the vessel
round, scarcely even by forcing her bows hard aground over the
banks. She was anchored head and stern, and guard-boats were
placed round her all night, for fear of any attempt at surprise.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the 14th, the Nemesis again pursued
her course up what appeared to be the principal branch, but
which became so shallow that it was doubtful how far she would
be able to proceed; she had seldom more than six feet water, and
in many places only five, so that she was frequently forced through
the mud itself. There was not room to turn her fairly round,
and the only mode in which she could be managed was by sometimes
driving her bows as far as possible into the river's bank,
sometimes her stern; while at other times it was hard to say
whether she was proceeding over a flooded paddy-field, or in the
channel of a water-course. This gave occasion to a facetious
remark, in which sailors sometimes delight, that this "would be
a new way of going overland to England."</p>

<p>After proceeding only three or four miles, a village came in
sight, with a fort adjoining, and rather above it. This was afterwards
found to be named Kong-How. Nearly opposite the fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the river was again found to be staked across, much more
strongly than it was at Houchong; and it was in a similar
manner commanded by the guns of the fort. The Nemesis, as
soon as she came within good range, opened her fire warmly
upon the fort, which the Chinese returned. The boats pushed
off as usual; but the moment the marines and a party of seamen
began to land, the Chinese abandoned the fort in confusion.</p>

<p>On the upper side of the fort, sand-bags were found recently
piled up against the walls, as if the Chinese had expected the
attack to be made on that side; which shews that they anticipated
that an attempt would be made to explore these passages,
but that they rather looked for it from the side of Tycocktow
than from Macao. The works, with their nine guns and magazine,
were afterwards all blown up at once.</p>

<p>The principal obstacle now remaining to be got rid of was one
more troublesome than all the forts together, or any impediment
yet met with. The line of piles which had been driven in across
the river was not less than twenty feet wide, or rather it was a
double line, filled up between the two with large sunken junks
laden with stones. Great labour and perseverance were required
to get up sufficient of these piles to clear a passage broad enough
for the steamer to pass. This was only accomplished after four
hours hard work, in which, oddly enough, the Chinese peasantry
bore an active part, voluntarily coming forward to assist, and
even venturing to come on board the steamer itself. This was,
undoubtedly, one of the good results of not having inflicted any
injury upon the country people or inhabitants of the villages
through which the little expedition had passed.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>A little above this obstruction a large chop-house or mandarin-station
came into view, with a mandarin-barge lying just
off it. A shot fired into the principal building soon drove out
all the soldiers who had taken refuge in it&mdash;probably the mandarin's
guard. The boats were now sent ashore, and soon destroyed
the whole of the buildings, together with the mandarin-boat,
with a gun and two ginjals. It was not possible for the
steamer to tow any of the boats or junks away with her, because
she was continually touching the ground, and frequently forcing
herself through the mud, so that it would have been impossible
to have got on at all if she had been impeded by any other
encumbrance; they were therefore all destroyed.</p>

<p>As soon as the boats had all returned from their service on
shore, the steamer pushed on again, and the water began to
deepen; so that at half-past six she was able to come to anchor
for the night in five fathoms water. From this point the high
rock of Lankeet, in the Canton river, could be easily recognised,
bearing about due east, and not very far distant.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th, having proceeded about three
miles further on, a large village, called Tamchow, came into
view, on the left bank of the river. Here a party of matchlockmen
were observed crouching along the banks of the river,
endeavouring to pass unnoticed. A few rounds of musketry at
once dispersed them.</p>

<p>Again the steamer pursued her course, without finding anything
particularly worthy of notice for a couple of hours, when
she came to a large town on the left bank of the river, (it is
remarkable that nearly all their towns and villages were on that
side,) which was called Tsenei, just above a place called Kwam,
close to which two or three dismantled and abandoned forts had
been passed. Here the chop or custom-house, which was also a
sort of military station, by the water-side, was set on fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
destroyed. A large war-junk, also, (probably the one which had
before escaped,) which mounted seven guns, was captured and
blown up, the crew having abandoned it on the approach of the
"devil-ship."</p>

<p>Above this point the channel again became very narrow and
shallow. The Chinese pilots now declared that it would be impossible
for the steamer to proceed much higher up, as the
passage was only deep enough for boats. Having nearly reached
a small place, called Weichung, the Nemesis was at length compelled
to desist from the attempt to pursue her course further in
that direction, particularly as it was now ebb-tide. Several other
channels could be seen on both sides, and one in particular appeared
to lead to the eastward, towards the main branch of the
Canton river, below Whampoa. Accordingly, it was resolved to
follow this latter branch, with a view to join the advanced
squadron, if possible.</p>

<p>In this short passage a considerable walled town was passed,
at the distance of less than half a mile, with which the communication
was kept up by means of a canal, which could be
seen to enter the town under a large arch, or bridge. Upon this
a great number of people were collected, to watch the progress
of the steamer. The country around it was extremely well cultivated,
and the peasants were busy at their agricultural operations,
without any apparent fear. Shortly afterwards the Nemesis
found herself entering the main river, at a very short distance
below the pagoda at the Second Bar, and proceeded without
delay to join the light squadron which was at anchor in Whampoa
Reach, and received the congratulations of all parties. Captain
Elliot and suite then left the Nemesis, and proceeded on board
Captain Herbert's ship, the Calliope.</p>

<p>Thus ended this singular and highly successful expedition of
three days up the Broadway passage, during which so much had
been done towards disabling and annoying the enemy by the
steamer, assisted by the boats before mentioned, and the marines
of the Samarang, all under the direction of Captain Scott. This
exploit would have gratified most men, even as the work of a
single vessel, for a whole campaign. It need hardly be added,
that Captain Scott was the first to acknowledge and to bring to
public notice the value of the services of the Nemesis on this
occasion; and Captain Elliot, who was an eye-witness of all these
operations, bore similar testimony to their importance. They
were also mentioned in flattering terms by the commodore in his
public despatch. It must not be omitted that all the officers of
the vessel nobly and energetically bore their share in the labours
and dangers of the undertaking; and those who belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
boats of the Samarang and the Atalanta were equally conspicuous,
and had opportunities of distinguishing themselves on shore.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The result of this expedition was highly beneficial, and afforded
more insight into the nature of the country, and gave a more
correct estimate of the resources of the Chinese, than could have
been expected within so short a distance from Macao. Indeed,
considering how long that place had been the resort of Europeans,
it was astonishing how little was known of its neighbourhood.
The country on both sides of the passage was found to be fertile
and highly cultivated; while, in the neighbourhood of the villages,
the banks of the river were laid out in neatly cultivated
gardens. Everywhere there prevailed an air of comfort and of
thriving industry.</p>

<p>The peaceable, and, one may almost say, the apathetic, bearing
of the people generally, and their refraining from all hostile demonstrations,
are worthy of notice; particularly when we remember
that they must not only have heard of, but even perhaps been
witnesses to, the engagements at the Bogue, at Chuenpee, at the
First Bar, and elsewhere. Much, perhaps, may be attributed to
the valuable presence of Mr. Morrison and Mr. Thom, who, from
their accurate knowledge of the character of the people, knew
well how to allay their fears, and conciliate even their good
offices.</p>

<p>The whole loss on our side, during this adventurous trip, was
only three men wounded. Altogether, one hundred and fifteen
guns were destroyed, together with nine war-junks; and several
armed mandarin-boats, six batteries, and three government chop-houses
or military stations, together with barracks and magazines,
were also taken and set on fire.</p>

<p>One simple, but very natural question will now suggest itself.
We have seen that, even in channels unfrequented by Europeans,
and only partially known to exist, the Chinese were found to be
well provided with means of defence, not of recent construction
only, but many of them evidently of long standing. But the
Chinese government had not been at war with neighbouring
nations, nor could they have erected these internal defences
against any possible future outbreak of the foreigners who traded
with Canton. The latter had usually been very "respectfully
obedient;" and, even if they had been disposed at an earlier
period to come to blows with the Chinese, their measures would
have been directed almost exclusively against the Bogue forts,
which protected the main channel of the Canton river, leading to
Whampoa. This Inner or Broadway Passage was, at all events,
too shallow and intricate to admit of the passage of large ships;
and, indeed, we have seen that even the Nemesis had failed in
making her way through the upper portion of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>Against whom, then, we may ask, or for what purpose, were
the numerous forts erected? The government might have
thought proper to occupy the principal strong positions, with a
view to strengthen themselves against any outbreak or insubordination
of <i>their own people</i>; and disturbances of this kind have
not been unfrequent, even in despotic and obedient China. But
it is far more probable that these defences of their "inner waters"
were designed to keep in check the dangerous incursions of
pirates, or "Water Braves," who have always infested the coast
of China, and have been great enemies to its commerce, and a
source of uneasiness to its government. In a country in which
so large a portion of the population make their permanent home
upon the waters, some upon the innumerable canals and rivers
which intersect it in all directions, others along the extensive
sea-coast and among its numerous islands, it is not surprising
that pirates, or, as the Portuguese call them, Ladrones, should at
all times abound.</p>

<p>The means of subsistence being frequently precarious among
so populous a nation, and at no time to be acquired without
careful industry, and, at the same time, the real weakness of the
government, in spite of its bombastic edicts, have combined to
make the temptation to piracy almost irresistible. In not a few
instances the government have been compelled even to conciliate
or buy over the depredators; and, in spite of all their efforts to
suppress them, the ladrones have never ceased to infest the
coast to a greater or less extent. The temptations are always
numerous, and the desperate characters who gain their living by
smuggling are, at all times, as likely to gain it by <i>robbing</i>, whenever
the opportunity may appear more favourable. Hence, we
can scarcely wonder that the pirates had long become bold,
enterprising, well-organized, and successful in their efforts,
directed, however, almost exclusively against their own countrymen,
along the whole coast.</p>

<p>Such as <i>were</i> the banditti of Italy and Spain not long ago, or
the klephts of Greece, or the robbers of Hounslow Heath in
times past&mdash;such have been for centuries the pirates or ladrones
of China. They are, in fact, the highwaymen of the "Celestial
Empire;" for their rivers and water-communications are essentially
their highways.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, we are led to the conclusion, that
nearly all these defences in the Broadway Passage had been constructed
more with a view to the defence of the river against the
Chinese themselves, than under any apprehension that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
foreigners would ever force their way into it. This supposition
is further borne out by the fact that, even during the short expedition
of the Nemesis, bands of robbers, and boats filled with
men of a very suspicious character, were distinctly seen at a
distance, trying to take advantage of every opportunity of
plundering their countrymen <i>while the panic lasted</i>. Indeed, it
may with much truth be said, that on this, as on many other
occasions, the Chinese suffered a great deal more from the
excesses and misdeeds of their own people, than they did from
any hardships they encountered at the hands of their foreign
enemies during the war. Many ludicrous, no less than unfortunate,
scenes have been witnessed, of Chinese plundering parties
falling in each other's way accidentally, and then fighting for
each other's booty, while, just at the critical moment, a third
party would perhaps step in, and carry off the greater part of
what the others had been already fighting about; and perhaps
even these would, in their turn, be stripped by another fresh
party, before they could get fairly off with their prize.</p>

<p>In reality, the war itself served to disorganize the Chinese police,
and to diminish the authority of the local officers. Smuggling,
robbery, and multiplied outrages, were never more prevalent
throughout all the maritime districts than during the continuance
of hostilities.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the Canton River, these violent proceedings
arrived at length at such a height, that the fishermen,
in many instances, combined together for mutual defence, and
provided themselves with arms. But even these men, although,
doubtless, most of them started with the good intention of capturing
the pirates, or, at all events, of protecting their own property,
were tempted at last to become, in many instances, almost
as fraudulent as the regular ladrones. Some were bold enough
even to attack the foreigners, urged thereto perhaps by the promised
rewards of their own government. Others, having now
found out their own comparative strength, became salt-smugglers
and opium-smugglers; while others traded, smuggled, robbed,
or aided others to escape detection, just as it might best suit
their purpose for the moment.</p>

<p>Secret societies were at length formed; a sort of freemasonry
of crime was established; and, before the close of the war, they
had acquired such an organization as to make it dangerous to
move about in the neighbourhood of Hong-Kong or Macao.
They even sold passes to the trading-boats, which were intended
to exempt them from plunder, for a regular payment of so many
dollars a month; yet even these were not always respected.</p>

<p>Hong-Kong itself was in danger of daily attacks from these
daring bandits; and, as it became at length evident that the co-operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of <i>both</i> governments, the English and the Chinese,
could alone effectually put an end to such gross outrages, Sir
Henry Pottinger made proposals to that effect to the Chinese
authorities. Our own cruisers alone were scarcely sufficient to
effect the object, because the fact of their European shape and
rig rendered them easily distinguished at a distance, and thus the
pirates had plenty of time to escape. It was proposed, therefore,
to have a number of fast-sailing boats, built and rigged very
much after the Chinese fashion, with mat-sails, &amp;c., to be well
armed, and to be manned principally by our own men. They
would thus be able to come unsuspected upon the pirates.
Various other suggestions were made for the mutual co-operation
of the two governments in the good work; but, owing probably
to fear and jealousy, and perhaps a mixture of pride, these
offers were courteously and respectfully declined by the Chinese
government, who declared that it would be able, now that the
war was ended, to take effectual steps to put an end to this heavy
source of annoyance at the mouth of the Canton river.</p>

of it stood a semicircular fort, designed to command the passage on either side.
This was called Napier's Fort, from having been built expressly to commemorate the
discomfiture and ultimate death of that lamented nobleman. It mounted thirty-five guns.</p></div>

the channels, is very picturesque. The fine pagoda upon Whampoa, rising up, as it
were, out of a little mount of wood, and another similar one on the mainland higher up,
surrounded by rich fields and numerous winding streams, are striking objects. A few
scattered farm-houses, with their large, curved, angular roofs, together with the village
of Whampoa, and the numerous boats of all shapes and sizes plying upon the river, present
a peculiar and thoroughly Chinese prospect.</p></div>

exposed to the fire of the enemy, little less than either soldiers or sailors. They
showed the utmost coolness and personal courage; and it is but justice to them to remark
that their presence was always of the greatest value in every operation, even
though unarmed, and, as non-belligerents, unnoticed. Their knowledge of the language
and their good judgment frequently enlisted in our favour the people of the
country, who might have offered great annoyance, and they were often able to mitigate
the hardships even of war itself.</p></div>

Nemesis (except the lead) as she proceeded, for the native pilots were not found to be

exact; but in the original manuscript every fort and military station was marked in its
proper position. The names given in Captain Scott's despatch are spelt somewhat

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Inquiry has often been made what method was adopted in order to open a passage
through obstacles such as I have described above. It may, therefore, be here remarked,
that several modes were at different times resorted to, according to circumstances.
Where the stakes were not driven in very firmly, it was easy, by fastening a hawser
round the top of them, and making it fast to the steamer, to back her out, and pull them
one by one away; but as this was a tedious process, a hawser was sometimes fastened
round ten or a dozen of them in a line across the river, and carried from one to the
other, but fastened to each of them in such a way as to leave about a few fathoms of
slack rope between each pair. The end of the hawser was made fast to the steamer
with a tolerable length of line out, and she was then backed at full speed. The momentum
thus acquired was soon sufficient to drag the first pile away with a jerk; and
this one being fastened already to the next, as before described, with a fathom or two of
slack line between them, the force of the steamer, which still continued to back astern,
was sufficient to jerk that one away also; and thus proceeding at full speed backwards,
the steamer pulled them all away, one after the other, still remaining fastened together
by the hawser; but the power of the jerk was only applied to one at a time.
</p>
<p>
In cases where the stakes were driven in to some depth, or where the bed of the river
was tenacious, it was necessary to pull them fairly out perpendicularly, by luff-tackle
led up to the mast-head. The piles were gradually loosened a little by being pulled to
and fro; for which purpose chain-slings were passed round the head of the pile, and a
hawser being then made fast, was led aft along the deck; thus by being pulled in various
directions, sometimes one way and sometimes another, the pile was at length drawn
fairly out, something like drawing a tooth. The bows of the steamer were run nearly
close up to the piles during this operation, and she was steadied by a hawser run out
from the quarter to the banks of the river.
</p>
<p>
A great point seems to lie in the management of the steamer itself, so as to be able
to apply the power in the proper direction, and at the right moment. This is the more
important, as the stream is generally pouring through or over the stakes with the
greater impetuosity, owing to the obstruction it meets with from the obstacles in its
way. This also constitutes the difficulty of getting through the opening, even after it
is once made. It is often necessary to lay out a kedge on each bow to steady the
vessel, as she works her way through, and to prevent her from falling broadside on to
the stream.
</p>
<p>
Generally on these occasions the water was shallow, so that it was necessary to raise
both keels of the vessel, and also the drop-rudder, and therefore it was sometimes extremely
difficult to steer her under those circumstances, and the use of the kedges became
the more necessary. In the present instance a space of twenty-two feet was
opened, and the steamer was got through with considerable care and some difficulty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> It should be here mentioned, that Capt. Larkins, who formerly commanded one of
the East India Company's vessels, and had been long acquainted with the Chinese character,
volunteered his valuable services upon the occasion.</p></div></div>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>During the time the Nemesis, with the boats and marines of
the Samarang, and the boat of the Atalanta, were occupied in
destroying the works of the Chinese in the Broadway River, a
division of the light squadron, under the command of Captain
Herbert, had captured another fort in the upper part of the same
river, at the distance of only about two miles from Canton. The
vessels employed upon this occasion were the Modeste and Starling,
with the Madagascar steamer, and boats from most of the
ships of the advanced squadron, commanded by Captain Bethune,
viz., the Blonde, Conway, Calliope, Herald, Alligator, Hyacinth,
Nimrod, Pylades, and Cruiser.</p>

<p>On the 18th (March), they pushed through the upper channel
leading from Whampoa, which had been explored on a previous
occasion by the Nemesis, under the orders of Captain Herbert;
and late in the afternoon they entered the Broadway River without
any accident, although the passage was found very intricate,
owing to the number of shoals. The Modeste was only got
through with considerable difficulty, piloted by Captain Collinson,
and assisted by the Madagascar steamer. Captain Belcher
endeavoured to bring the Sulphur through, but failed, as she
grounded about four miles from the point of attack. The Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
steamer was found to draw too much water, and could not be
employed to tow her up.</p>

<p>The fort which they were about to attack was the same which
had before been seen at a distance by Captain Herbert in the
Nemesis, and was found to be of a circular form, strongly built
of stone, with a tower in the centre, and situated upon a small
alluvial islet in the middle of the river, which it completely commanded.
It was afterwards called the Macao fort, and was found
to mount twenty-two guns. The Chinese had made attempts to
strengthen this important post, as an outwork to impede the
advance of our forces upon Canton in that direction. With this
view they had constructed rafts across the river on both sides of
the fort, strengthened by a few piles and sunken junks, and
flanked by a sand battery, mounting eight small guns.</p>

<p>As soon as our vessels and boats approached, the Chinese
opened a well-sustained fire from the fort, which was returned
with good effect by the Modeste, which had been admirably
placed by Captain Eyres, within six hundred yards, assisted by
the Starling and Madagascar.</p>

<p>In about half an hour the whole of the works were carried,
but the Chinese maintained their fire until the rest of the force
were under the walls, when they fled out of it in all directions,
leaving several dead in the fort. On our side only three men
were wounded. Captain Kuper, and Commanders Barlow,
Giffard, Anson, and Clarke, volunteered their services on this
occasion, and the marines were commanded by Lieut. Stransham.
A large mandarin-boat was captured before the Chinese
could carry it away; and a small garrison was immediately
placed in the fort, the Modeste remaining at anchor some way
below it.</p>

<p>Thus another of the important defences of the Chinese in
advance of Canton had fallen; and the passage for our light
squadron up to the provincial capital lay almost completely open.
Our advanced ships had now been brought much nearer the city
than the Chinese, or perhaps even our own officers, had previously
thought possible. All the important operations which
have been described in the Broadway River, commencing from
Macao upwards, to within two miles of Canton, had been effected
in the short space of three days&mdash;viz., on the 13th, 14th, and
15th of March, 1841.</p>

<p>On the 16th, Captains Herbert, Bourchier, Bethune, and other
officers, came on board the Nemesis at Whampoa, and proceeded
along the upper channel towards the Macao passage. In the
afternoon, the Nemesis joined the Modeste, which was still at
anchor below the fort. A passage was soon cleared through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the rafts, and she pursued her course, with the object of taking
up a chop or despatch from Captain Elliot, addressed to the
imperial commissioner, and at the same time to explore the
nature of the passage above the fort. But, scarcely had she
passed the stakes, when she struck heavily upon a sunken rock.
This obstacle, however, was not situated in the broadest and
most frequented channel, which leads past the fort on its eastern
side, but in the narrower passage on the western side of the fort.
The concussion made the vessel tremble; and, had she been
built of wood instead of iron, she could hardly have escaped some
severe injury.</p>

<p>After considerable delay and exertion she was got off again.
Before she advanced further towards Canton, it was thought
proper to hoist a flag of truce; but, knowing at the same time
how little the Chinese respect for it could be depended on, a
division of armed boats was taken in tow, in case of meeting
with any sudden attack from the enemy.</p>

<p>Upwards of a mile further on, a newly-constructed field-work
was discovered upon a rising ground, surrounded and
partially concealed by trees. It was situated upon the left
bank of the river, and was called the Birdsnest Fort. In
front of it, the passage of the river was obstructed by a strong
raft, reaching quite across it, and well moored; while, further
on, just at the point of junction with the Canton river, a number
of war-junks and armed boats were drawn up for its defence,
nearly opposite Shameen, which is about half a mile above the
factories.</p>

<p>The steamer was now stopped; and it was resolved to send a
boat, with a flag of truce flying, in order to attempt to carry up
Captain Elliot's letter. The flag of truce was also flying upon
the Nemesis and all the other boats. Captain Bethune, having
undertaken this charge, had just pushed off from the steamer,
when a shower of grape-shot was discharged from the Birdsnest
Fort. Fortunately no injury was done, as the shot passed over
the boats; but the flags of truce were immediately lowered, and
the guns of the Nemesis, and also those of the boats, opened fire
upon the fort, in retaliation of the hostile act of the Chinese.
At the same time, the junks ahead, and also the battery at Shameen,
commenced a distant straggling fire, much beyond effective
range. A rocket thrown from the Nemesis fell into the
middle of the fort, and partially set fire to the buildings, and it
would have been very easy to have carried the works by assault;
but orders to the contrary were given by Captain Herbert, who
was not desirous of carrying hostilities further, without the sanction
of Captain Elliot. He immediately returned to Whampoa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in order to bring up some of the light squadron, with a view to
advance, if necessary, upon Canton itself.</p>

<p>There were good reasons for not wasting time at the fort that
evening; but, unfortunately, it is the practice of the Chinese
always to claim a victory, and to report upon it accordingly to
the Emperor, on every occasion on which any portion of our
forces withdrew from before any of their defences, without having
first occupied them. In the present instance, it was reported,
that even a devil-ship had been driven away by the imperial
troops from the Birdsnest Fort, and the high distinction of a
peacock's father was conferred upon the commandant of it, as a
reward for his courage!</p>

<p>Upon reaching Whampoa again the same evening in the
Nemesis, Captain Herbert received a communication from Captain
Elliot, respecting the measures to be adopted in consequence
of the insult which had been offered to the flag of truce. Captain
Elliot pointed out to him that the "Chinese knew perfectly well
the value of the white flag, for they had often taken advantage of
it to communicate with our forces:" and he then dwelt upon the
"necessity of resisting this aggression with all the promptitude
which might be compatible with considerations of a military
nature." At the same time, he requested Captain Herbert to
"confine his operations to the fort from which the shot was
actually fired." It would seem, however, that Captain Herbert
took upon himself the responsibility of the operations against
Canton, which are shortly to be described; for he expressed
himself in one of his despatches to the effect, that he had
"found himself forced to make his arrangements without any
instructions from his superior officer, Sir Gordon Bremer; but
that he felt that he had no alternative but to resent with all
promptitude the insult offered to the flag of truce." Arrangements
were accordingly made, without loss of time, for proceeding
to active operations.</p>

<p>The want of interpreters was at this time very much felt by
Captain Herbert. He repeatedly applied for some one to be
sent up to him in that capacity; and he wrote to the commodore,
"that there was not a single person in the advanced squadron
who understood a word of the language." The difficulty of
procuring supplies was consequently very much increased, particularly
as the authorities at Canton had forbidden the people to
carry provisions to the squadron. The difficulty of obtaining
accurate information of any kind was very great; but it had
been already positively ascertained that the authorities of Canton
had prevented a single chest of tea, or any other article of export,
from leaving Canton, long before even the attack upon the Macao<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Fort; and it was also known that a considerable body of Tartar
troops had already reached the city. In short, all the information
which could be obtained fully confirmed the impression
conveyed by the insult to the flag of truce, that the Chinese were
making active preparations for the resumption of hostilities, and
that the sooner we had recourse to active measures the better.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th, Captain Elliot and suite, together
with Captains Herbert, Bourchier, and other officers, proceeded
in the Nemesis towards the Macao passage, or Broadway river,
where she rejoined the vessels at anchor below the Macao Fort.
It was a favourite scheme of Captain Elliot, at this time, to
endeavour to command all the lines of water-communication to
the westward of Canton, so as to cut off <i>the supplies</i> from the
city, and stop the local trade.</p>

<p>The rivers or creeks, and their branches in this neighbourhood,
are extremely numerous. Some little distance below the
Macao Fort a considerable branch turns off to the westward, and
leads, at the distance of several miles, up to Tatshan. About a
mile and a half within this passage another channel leads off to
the northward, in the direction of the Canton river, which it
enters a little above Shameen, on the opposite side. This
channel was narrow, and not navigable, except for boats. The
Hyacinth had, on the previous day, been pushed into the Tatshan
passage, nearly as far as the point where the smaller
channel turns off to Canton, but there she stuck, owing to the
shoalness of the water.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, therefore, having in tow a division of boats, was
now moved up the Tatshan passage, and shortly communicated
with the Hyacinth, which was at anchor there. She then turned
up the northern branch, which was afterwards called the Fatee
creek, in the hope of being able to push up to the Canton river
in that direction, and so cut off all the Chinese boats which
might attempt to escape up the river. After proceeding some
distance, the water was found too shallow and the passage very
narrow, and she was compelled to return, having captured on
her way a very handsome mandarin-boat. In the evening she
rejoined the squadron in the Macao passage, where the Commodore,
Sir Gordon Bremer, had just arrived in the Madagascar
steamer, which had been sent for him. The dispositions had
already been made by Captain Herbert, for the capture of all the
remaining defences in advance of Canton, on the following day;
and Sir Gordon Bremer was therefore unwilling to disturb the
arrangements.</p>

<p>The 18th March, 1841, will ever be remembered as the great
day upon which the city of Canton was first humbled; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
whole of the works which had been erected for its defence, along
its river front, were captured by H.M. naval forces.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the almost innumerable
boats which crowd most of the rivers of China, and perhaps none
more so than that of Canton, upon which it is stated that there
is a floating population, permanently living on the water, of no
less than forty thousand souls. They are the small traders,
hucksters, fishermen, and public carriers of the country; and
always appear an industrious and contented portion of the
people. Of course, the numerous body of smugglers belong to
this class.</p>

<p>It was said that one of the most influential smugglers, whose
avocations had long been winked at by the authorities, who were
themselves participators in the gains, had been suddenly arrested,
and threatened with the confiscation of all his property, and even
death; but that a free pardon was offered to him if he would
contrive to collect together all the best boats, and furnish the
men with arms; putting them under the orders of the mandarins,
to co-operate for the defence of the city. Accordingly, a
vast number of these boats were seen at a distance, drawn up in
a curved line across the river, at the mouth of the Macao
passage.</p>

<p>Besides these, it was known that some gun-boats, completely
formed after European models, and thoroughly coppered, had
been equipped by the government. Our flotilla of men-of-war-boats
was therefore to be employed in pursuing and destroying
this legion of the enemy.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven, the Nemesis commenced the attack upon
the little battery, called by us the Birdsnest Fort, which she had
engaged two days before, She opened her fire of guns and
rockets with effect, and the Chinese returned the fire with spirit
for some time; but the Modeste and Madagascar joined in the
attack, and it is not surprising that the fort was silenced in a
very short space of time. Some of the boats immediately pushed
off to make themselves masters of the place, and the Chinese
were chased out of it in great confusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>Another field-work, almost close to it, was also captured at the
same time. They were found to mount upwards of thirty guns,
which, together with the magazine, were destroyed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Starling and Algerine had contrived to
force a passage through the raft, and had scarcely got to the other
side, when a small sand-bag battery and several war-junks opened
their fire upon them, very near the point of junction with the
Canton river. The Hebe and Louisa took part in this affair;
and the Nemesis came up as soon as the lower forts had been
silenced; part of the flotilla of boats, under Captain Bourchier,
also arrived, and the sand-battery was soon carried, while the
war-junks and the flotilla of Chinese armed boats already began
to disperse.</p>

<p>A strong fort, opposite the city, mounting twenty guns, called
the Rouge Fort, was next silenced, but was not taken possession
of immediately. Later in the day, however, a boat from the
Nemesis, under Lieut. Pedder, was sent to hoist our flag upon
it; and another party from the Sulphur landed nearly at the
same time under Captain Belcher.</p>

<p>The large Chinese flotilla before described, was pursued up
the river by the Nemesis and the boats, and was soon in a state
of indescribable confusion.</p>

<p>At this moment, the division of boats under Captain Belcher
and Captain Warren succeeded in getting through the Fatee
creek, and, coming suddenly down upon the Chinese boats,
which were already so closely pursued, destroyed an immense
number of them. Some were driven ashore, some were sunk,
and a few escaped up the creeks in the rear of the town.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, in the meantime, had opened her fire upon the
Shameen Fort, in the western suburbs of the city; and, under
cover of her guns, Captain Bethune put off from her; and a
division of boats, with Captains Belcher and Warren at their
head, also landed and took the fort, after some resistance. It
mounted ten guns.</p>

<p>While these operations were going on in the upper part of the
river, the Madagascar had gone down and taken up a position
not far from the Dutch Folly, which was a circular fort, in the
middle of the river, directly opposite the city, mounting twenty-five
guns. In front of it a number of junks laden with stones
had been sunk. A small sand-battery of three guns, close to the
naval arsenal, which is on the south side of the river, was at the
same time carried by another division of boats. Four of the new
Chinese gun-boats were also captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>A little before one o'clock, about an hour after the first shot of
the day had been fired, and after all the detached forts and
batteries, except the so-called Dutch Folly, had been taken,
Captain Elliot came on board the Nemesis, and desired that he
might be conveyed to the British factory, with a <i>flag of truce</i>
hoisted, it being clearly his intention to endeavour to treat at
once, without further employment of force. However, scarcely
had she got down opposite the European factories, and only
within distant range of the Dutch Folly, when the latter opened
fire on her, in spite of the flag of truce. Instantly it was hauled
down, the fire was returned by other vessels, and the result was
that the fort was soon silenced.</p>

<p>The Nemesis then proceeded some little way down the river,
towards the Dutch Folly, in company with several boats of the
squadron. This circular fort was taken possession of by a party
of marines and seamen; and, not far from it, four new gun-boats,
built according to European models, were boarded and
taken, their crews having abandoned them. The Chinese naval
forces offered, in fact, little or no resistance throughout the day;
and even their forts, which fired with considerable spirit at a
distance, were soon abandoned by their garrisons, when there
was any certainty of their coming to close quarters with our
men.</p>

<p>At half-past one, Captain Elliot being still on board the
Nemesis, she was ordered to return close to the factories, where
Captain Hall landed, accompanied by Mr. Morrison, and hastened
at once to the British factory, both being equally eager to take
possession of it again. In a few moments the British flag was
displayed in triumph, with three cheers, which were returned by
the steamer and boats. At the same time, Captain Belcher also
hastened up towards the factory with a party of men, and was
preparing to hoist the colours upon the flag-staff in front of the
Factory, when, at that very moment, they were waved from the
window of the Factory, by Captain Hall himself.</p>

<p>As all the defences had now been taken, and Canton lay completely
at our mercy, one would hardly have expected that any
further resistance would have been made. But the Chinese
have a fancy of their own for renewing a combat in detached
parties, long after all possibility of doing good by it has ceased.
On many occasions during the war, they suffered severely and
justly for thus uselessly harassing our men after the day was
over, and when our troops were in possession of all the enemy's
positions.</p>

<p>On this occasion, as Captain Hall and his party were returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to their boat, a body of soldiers rushed out upon them, but were
driven back to a narrow street called Hog Lane, beyond the
British factory, and were even pursued for some distance up that
narrow passage. Many of them were killed while retreating
although they crouched down behind their large ratan shields for
shelter at each discharge. It was thought imprudent to pursue
them far, as in so narrow a space, with low houses on one side,
and a dead wall on the other, the retreat of the pursuers might
have been cut off. Captain Belcher and his party were also
attacked at the same time, and gallantly put the enemy to flight
with some loss, pursuing them as far as was prudent.</p>

<p>The Chinese shewed no further disposition to come to close
quarters, and our men returned to their boats without further
molestation. One man belonging to the Nemesis was wounded
during the affray.</p>

<p>Little now remained to be done but to take possession of and
destroy some of the boats and junks which had been overlooked
in the hurry of more important matters. Late in the evening,
the Nemesis anchored in company with the squadron, off the
western suburbs of the city, nearly a mile above the factory. The
flags of truce were still flying, and it must be admitted that
greater forbearance towards the Chinese, or more unwillingness
to proceed to the infliction of suffering upon the people or city of
Canton, could not possibly have been exhibited than on this
memorable day of the first capture of Canton.</p>

<p>It must not be omitted to state that Commodore Sir Gordon
Bremer, got up, towards the close of the action, in the Hyacinth's
gig, just in time to see the British flag displayed from the
Factory. The Herald also arrived as a reinforcement, in the
latter part of the day.</p>

<p>One officer and six or seven men wounded were the only
casualties on our side, throughout all the operations of the 18th
of March.</p>

<p>It was said that several desultory outbreaks of the mob occurred
during the evening of this day, which were with some
difficulty suppressed by the police. They were in most instances
the outbursts of the evil passions of the demoralized mob of
Canton, the worst of all the subjects of China, attracted to the
centre of foreign commerce, by the hope of profit, or the opportunity
of exercising their bad ingenuity. In no part of China
has the feeling of hostility to the foreigner prevailed more
strongly against us than at Canton. In many other districts,
the English force was even welcomed, or, at all events, received
without insult or violence.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that, during the whole of the following
day, the 19th, nothing of importance was done, either as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
further progress of hostilities, or as to the demanding any
specified terms from the Chinese. It is easy to guess what interpretation
was put upon our inactivity by the authorities and
the people. The motive on our part seems to have been principally
one of pure compassion, and an unwillingness to take
the initiative of <i>proposing</i> terms to the Chinese, which it was
their part, as the conquered, to solicit.</p>

<p>After the lapse of one entire day, Captain Elliot and suite
were carried down to the Factory in the Nemesis, on the morning
of the 20th, where they landed soon after mid-day. There could
be little doubt that something important would now be settled.
Captain Elliot was bent upon getting the trade opened, and no
less so upon bringing about a cessation of hostilities. He was
not altogether wrong, perhaps, even in the slowness of his proceedings,
considering the extraordinary circumstances in which
he was placed. He seems to have merely miscalculated the importance,
or perhaps the exigency, of the political crisis in
which he found himself placed. He probably viewed the whole
matter almost exclusively as a commercial question.</p>

<p>The first public notification was by a circular dated at the hall
of the British Factory, by which it was announced that a suspension
of hostilities had been agreed upon between the imperial
commissioner, Yang-Fang and Captain Elliot. It was further
agreed that the trade of the port of Canton should at once be
opened. With regard to the opium trade, it was settled that no
bond, such as had formerly been demanded by Lin, should now
be required, but that the same liabilities should be incurred by
any British subject detected in the act of introducing any unlawful
goods, as would follow the same offences in England.
Captain Elliot also distinctly intimated that, "pending the final
settlement of affairs between the two countries, the usual port
charges and other dues should continue to be paid as heretofore."</p>

<p>All those who had watched the course of events, and had
studied in the slightest degree the Chinese character, could only
look upon this temporary arrangement as the mere preliminary
of the resumption of hostilities, not as the settlement of peace.
In itself, this insignificant demand was almost equivalent to an
acknowledgment of failure. That it was so viewed by Sir Gordon
Bremer is evident, from the notice which he issued on the next
day, the 21st, dated at the Bogue, in which he declared that all
vessels proceeding to Whampoa, under this agreement, must do
so at the risk of the possible resumption of hostilities.</p>

<p>On the side of the Chinese, a proclamation was issued by
Yang, as joint commissioner, (the other two had not yet arrived,)
to the effect that, "as Elliot had represented that all he wanted
was peace and permission to trade as formerly, and as all trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
depended upon the cherishing goodness of the celestial court,
that therefore it was right <i>now</i> to permit the English to trade as
well as other people, in order to shew a compassionate regard."
It was further added, that henceforth the people were carefully to
look to and well treat the merchant vessels at Whampoa, as well
as the merchants at Canton.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the slender grounds upon which it was
agreed that our force should be withdrawn from before Canton,
after all the treasure, and labour, and some loss of life, which had
been expended in bringing it there.</p>

A large flotilla of boats, from the squadron generally, was placed under the command
of Captain Bourchier assisted by Captain Bethune, and was formed in four divisions,
three of which were under the orders of Commanders Barlow and Clarke, and Lieut.
Coulson, and the fourth commanded by Captain Belcher and Captain Warren. The
whole together must have amounted to little less than forty in number. Upwards of
fifty naval officers took part in the operations of this large flotilla alone; the services
of which were likely to be of the greatest importance in capturing and destroying the
immense flotilla of Chinese boats, of all forms and sizes, which had been pressed into
the service of the government for the defence of Canton.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>The agreement for the suspension of hostilities, made at Canton
by Captain Elliot, on the 20th March, 1841, was only entered
into with <i>one</i> of the three newly-appointed imperial commissioners,
Yang-Fang being, in fact, the only one who had then
arrived. Lung-Wan, the principal joint-commissioner, and Yih-Shan,
the Tartar-general associated with him, did not arrive until
about three weeks afterwards, when they brought with them a
large body of troops, imperfectly armed and little organized. The
news of what had already happened must have astonished them
beyond all conception.</p>

<p>In the meantime trade went on with great activity, but much
caution, at Canton. It was generally believed, nevertheless, that
the temporary calm upon the surface would be of short duration,
and the growing storm upon the horizon, gave a warning to
all who were interested in passing events, to set their house in
order.</p>

<p>Rumours were abroad of extensive preparations being actively
in progress by the Chinese, somewhere or other above Canton;
but the precise situation of them was not discovered until the
second attack was made upon the city, in the month of May. It
was said that numerous fire-rafts were being constructed, war-junks
equipped, and troops collected; and it was little doubted
that, as soon as the principal mercantile transactions (which were
as important to the Chinese as they were to the foreigners)
should be completed, a renewal of hostilities would take place.</p>

<p>In the meantime it was satisfactory to the European residents
to know that, as the greater part of our ships of war were at
Whampoa, or in that neighbourhood, many of them could be
speedily brought up to Canton; and, moreover, the Modeste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Algerine, Hyacinth, and Herald, were still at anchor, much nearer
the city. They had only withdrawn to the Macao passage, at the
distance of a couple of miles from Canton, after the commencement
of the truce.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, meantime, had gone down to Macao, whither
she conveyed Captain Elliot and his suite, and took the opportunity
of the temporary pause to complete her necessary repairs.
Sir Gordon Bremer, at this time, thought it right to go up in
person to Calcutta, to represent the state of affairs to the Governor-General,
and to request reinforcements. He sailed on or
about the 31st March, in the H.C. steamer, Queen; leaving
Captain Sir Le Fleming Senhouse in command of the naval
forces during his absence.</p>

<p>For some time after the commencement of the truce, the native
inhabitants and traders of the city, some of whom, however, had
retired from it altogether, continued to pursue their ordinary
avocations with some appearance of returning confidence. A
proclamation was issued by the governor, tending to allay any
remaining apprehensions they might have, and similar pacific
assurances were addressed by the authorities, repeatedly, both to
the native and foreign residents, even till the very day when
their scarcely concealed projects of vengeance were to be attempted.</p>

<p>On the 5th April, Captain Elliot again returned to the factory
at Canton, and, during his short residence there, of ten or twelve
days, the authorities and the new commissioners succeeded in so
far blinding the plenipotentiary to all their hostile purposes, that
he himself publicly declared that he was perfectly satisfied with
all their "<i>assurances</i> of good faith, and their disposition to fulfil
their engagements." The day before he left Canton again&mdash;namely,
on the 16th April&mdash;he expressed himself decidedly to
the same purport, in a public proclamation, addressed, however,
rather to the Chinese people than to his own countrymen, but
calculated likewise to reassure the latter, should they be unable
to form any judgment for themselves. And he moreover assured
Sir Le Fleming Senhouse that "he entertained no uneasiness for
life and property at Canton."</p>

<p>Captain Elliot left the Factory on the following day, and returned
to Macao; not, however, without first urging upon Sir
Le Fleming Senhouse the propriety of removing our ships further
off from the city. He requested that the vessels which were
before Shameen should be moved down to the Macao fort, in
order to shew our peaceful disposition; and he recommended
that proper respect should be manifested to the government, and
that the officers in command should do all in their power to uphold
its character in the sight of the people, "compatible with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the paramount necessity of keeping awake a lively sense that
renewed ill faith would be responded to by an immediate blow."</p>

<p>All this had very little effect in rendering the foreign community
less apprehensive of a resumption of hostilities.</p>

<p>For a very brief space appearances were favourable, but fresh
troops soon began pouring into the town; and some of the
natives have since admitted that they even knew that, in secret,
fresh cannon were being cast, and extensive preparations, of
every description, urged on in the quietest possible manner,
evidently with a view to some sudden and unwarned explosion.</p>

<p>Immediately before leaving Canton, on the 17th April, Captain
Elliot seemed resolved to take some steps against the continuance
of the trade in opium within the river. He applied to Sir Le
Fleming Senhouse to prevent any small vessels from passing
into the river within the Bogue, unless provided with a passport
signed by the plenipotentiary. These passes were to be issued to
those alone who could afford him assurance, to his own satisfaction,
that the boats or small craft should <i>only</i> be employed in
the conveyance of passengers, letters, or supplies. They were
to be obtained by foreigners through their own consuls, who
would apply to him for them. But he reserved to himself the
right of cancelling them whenever he should see cause to determine
that such a course "should be necessary in <i>discharge of his
engagements</i>;" and, moreover, every ship or vessel was to be
forcibly expelled from the river, if it were proved to his satisfaction
that she was engaged in "<i>dangerous pursuits</i>" calculated
to disturb the truce and interrupt the general trade.</p>

<p>This could, of course, only allude to the trade in opium, and
the whole proceeding seems expressly to have been arranged
between Captain Elliot and the Chinese authorities, for he actually
obtained from the Kwang-chow-foo, or prefect, <i>licences</i>, bearing
his official seal, which he could himself distribute to those vessels
to which he issued his passports, and which were to have the
effect of exempting them from <i>all visit or examination by the
Chinese officers</i>, whether connected with the customs or any other
department.</p>

<p>One cannot help remarking that this measure, which, however,
was only partially carried into effect, gave an immense advantage
to the Chinese authorities, while, on our sides, we totally lost
sight of the main question at issue. The point gained by the
Chinese was, that they at once threw into the back-ground every
other question but that of trade, and, above all, that of trade in
opium, which, therefore, they ingeniously tried to make appear
the "fons et origo" of the whole dispute; and having got Elliot
to lend assistance <i>to them</i> in <i>one</i> point, it gave them the advantage
of appearing to justify themselves in the eyes of their countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and, indeed, in the opinion of foreigners at a distance, and
who were in ignorance of the real state of things, for the greater
part of their preposterous and violent proceedings. On our part, it
tended to put on one side, as if of minor consideration, the "demand
for reparation and redress for injuries inflicted," as her
Majesty declared in her speech from the throne, "upon some of
her subjects by the imperial officers, and for the <i>indignities</i>
offered to an agent of her crown;" this agent being no other than
Captain Elliot himself! It put out of sight the indignities
offered to Lord Napier, and all who had been concerned in any
way in the conduct of our communications with China since the
abolition of the exclusive privileges of the East India Company.
It overlooked the proper spirit of indignation, which could hardly
fail to animate every man who had been imprisoned, insulted,
and starved into concessions, which he could have otherwise had
no right or authority to yield.</p>

<p>That at this stage of the proceedings endless difficulties appeared
to beset the questions at issue, may very justly be urged.
But we have at all times to consider the character of the people
with whom a question is at issue, in an almost equal degree with
the question itself. And it will scarcely be questioned that the
character of the Chinese, and especially of the officers of their
government, was at that time imperfectly understood. In reality,
the proceedings on both sides, between the first conquest of
Canton on the 18th of March, and its second surrender under
the agreement of ransom upon the 26th of May (which remains
yet to be described) were evidently temporary expedients on both
sides; on that of the Chinese, to gain time for the preparation of
more efficient means of resistance, and for relief from immediate
"pressure;" on that of their opponents for the completion of the
<i>commercial</i> transactions of the season.</p>

<p>For some time after the commencement of the truce, a guard
of marines was stationed in the Factories; but, as soon as
Captain Elliot's "assurance proclamation" was issued, they were
withdrawn. Up to that time there had been, as is usually the
case, a division in the councils to a certain extent; but now the
"war and extermination" party got completely the upper hand,
and their hopes of success were much encouraged by a report
which reached them, that the main body of our force was about
to proceed to the northward, to operate on the coast. This was,
in fact, really intended, as will be seen presently, although it
was subsequently deferred, owing to reports of the preparations
at Canton, and the expectation of a speedy outbreak.</p>

<p>The Emperor's proclamations to all the maritime districts continued
to breathe a spirit of uncompromising war; and the governor
of the province of Che-keang, (under whom are the Chusan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Islands,) the venerable Elepoo, was severely reproved for having
permitted the barbarians to <i>retire</i> from Chusan under Keshen's
treaty, instead of having advanced to <i>drive</i> them out by force,
and to effect their destruction.</p>

<p>Thus, at the commencement of May, the speedy resumption of
hostilities seemed inevitable; and the report brought from the
northward by the Columbine, Captain Clarke, of the preparations
which were being carried on by the Chinese, and of the refusal
of the authorities of Che-keang to receive from that officer a
despatch which he had been ordered and sent expressly to
deliver, tended to confirm every previous impression.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Nor
was this all. Information was brought from Canton that, on
the 30th April, no less than forty boats had passed in front of
the Factories, having on board at least two thousand troops;
that they proceeded a little lower down, and landed at a short
distance from the Dutch Folly, and thence marched into the
city.</p>

<p>An explanation of this circumstance was demanded, and an
evasive reply was sent by the Kwang-chow-foo, or prefect, to
Captain Elliot. A few days afterwards, it was distinctly reported
that the English at Canton were to be suddenly attacked, and
all their property destroyed. And, on the 8th May, no less than
seventy more boats passed before the Factories, bringing down
full three thousand troops to the city, and these were said to be the
advanced guard of a large army. It was known, also, that a vast
number of fire-rafts were being prepared, and several hundred
divers were said to be in training, who were to go down and
bore holes in our ships at night; or even, as the Chinese privately
reported, to carry down with them some combustible
material which would burn under water and destroy our vessels.</p>

<p>The Nemesis was, during all this time, incessantly employed
in carrying letters and despatches, as well as officers, from one
place to another. Constant communications were kept up; Sir
Le Fleming Senhouse and Captain Elliot were continually
passing and repassing to and from different points within
the river&mdash;frequently up to Whampoa, or even to the neighbourhood
of the very Factories at Canton.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>At the same period, arrangements for the complete settlement
and government of Hong-Kong were being continued without
intermission. Officers were appointed, a magistrates court
formed, proclamations issued, and establishments of various
kinds commenced. In short, it seemed very evident that we had
no intention of restoring the island to the Chinese, whatever
might be the reply of the Emperor to Keshen's treaty.</p>

<p>Preparations had already been commenced at Hong-Kong for
the advance of our force upon Amoy, under Sir Hugh Gough,
with a view to carry on hostilities further to the northward; but
they were now temporarily suspended, in order to meet the approaching
crisis at Canton.</p>

<p>If anything had been wanting to confirm the rumour, not
only of the extensive preparations of the Chinese government to
recommence the attack, but also to indicate the disposition of
the people of Canton towards us, it was to be found in a curious
address, or chop, publicly circulated in the city, and even posted
upon its walls. It purported to express the sentiments of the
people themselves, or to be an address from that portion which
claimed to be most patriotic to the other portion which might
possibly be less so. It was intended to inflame the public mind
against us, but it was not sealed or <i>apparently</i> sanctioned by the
government.</p>

<p>All this was designed, of course, to frighten the barbarians;
and although it professed to be a mere ebullition of the spirit of
the people, there is little doubt that the government were cognizant
of it. This is rendered more probable by the circumstance
that, only a few days afterwards, the prefect of the city
issued distinct orders to the elders of the people, that they
should cause them to remove their wives and children, with
all their moveable property, from the neighbourhood of the
river.</p>

<p>At length, even Captain Elliot himself began to catch a
glimmering of the truth, which seemed to steal but slowly upon
his unwilling eyes. On the 10th of May he resolved to go in
person to Canton in the Nemesis, and, in order the better to impress
the Chinese with the opinion which he retained of their
good faith, he even took up Mrs. Elliot with him&mdash;probably the
first time an English female had set foot in Canton.</p>

<p>The next morning the Nemesis was moved down to the Macao,
or Broadway Passage, about three quarters of a mile from the
Factories. Captain Elliot, as soon as he landed at the Factory,
sought an interview with the Kwang-chow-foo, or prefect, and demanded
certain explanations from him, which evidently embarrassed
him not a little. The answers were evasive and
unsatisfactory; previously-lurking suspicions were more than
confirmed, and Captain Elliot left the Factory that same evening,
<i>preferring to sleep on board the Nemesis</i>.</p>

<p>No time was now to be lost in seeking a conference with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
naval and military commanders-in-chief, who were then at Hong-Kong;
and, accordingly, on the following morning, the 12th,
the Nemesis was ordered to convey him, with all speed, down the
river to that place, a communication being made, on his way
down, to Captain Herbert, commanding the advanced squadron
at Whampoa, who was already prepared for an approaching
crisis. The result of the conference held at Hong-Kong the
same day was, that the expedition to Amoy was to be positively
postponed, and the whole disposable force moved once more
towards Canton.</p>

<p>Hong-Kong was now the scene of general bustle and activity,
a new disposition of the forces was made, and every measure
adopted for their speedy junction as near as possible to Canton.
By the judicious exertions of Sir Le Fleming Senhouse, and the
hearty co-operation of all his officers, eager once more for active
employment, the whole fleet of men-of-war and transports, with
all the troops on board, were ready to sail in five days. Every
man that could be spared, except the invalids and convalescents,
was embarked; and every ship of war, except the Druid,
which was left for the protection of the harbour, was under orders
for the Canton river.</p>

<p>On the 18th and 19th, having been a little delayed by calms,
they all got away in admirable order, full of high hope and
promise that now, at length, they were to become masters of the
great southern emporium of foreign commerce.</p>

<p>Captain Elliot now once more proceeded to Canton, as usual,
in the Nemesis, which took him up there in a very few hours.
He returned to his quarters in the Factory; but, so incontrovertible
were the evidences of the hostile intentions of the
Chinese, and so strong the apprehension of the momentary
bursting forth of some treacherous plot, that the Nemesis, which
was the only vessel at hand, was kept cleared for action, with the
guns loaded, steam up, and the cable in readiness to slip,
although no immediate danger was visible.</p>

<p>Captain Elliot now very properly advised the merchants, by
public proclamation, to make their arrangements, so as to be
prepared to leave Canton at a moment's notice. On the following
day, the 20th, the Nemesis was moved close up to the
Factories, or a little above them, for the protection of the whole
foreign community. It was already discovered that the western
battery above the city at Shameen had been repaired and armed
at least ten days before; that a large encampment had been
formed to the eastward of the town, for some of the newly-arrived
troops; while new works had also been erected on the
river-side in the same direction&mdash;that is, below the town, in the
rear of the French Folly. Tartar troops were still pouring into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the city in great numbers, while the citizens themselves were
hastening out of it with precipitation. Goods and chattels of all
kinds were being carried away; confusion was evident where
everything is usually so orderly; and it is said that soldiers were
even seen moving about with matchlocks, and their slow matches
ready lighted in their hands.</p>

<p>Our own forces were by this time on the way up, the troops
from Hong-Kong had already passed the Bogue, and the light
squadron had begun to move from Whampoa. Still Captain
Elliot was in the Factory, and still a great portion of the
merchants remained at their posts, ready to decamp at a moment's
notice, yet anxiously devoting every doubtful moment of delay to
the purpose of arranging, as well as they could, their complicated
affairs.</p>

<p>The Chinese, finding that their plans were now fairly discovered,
were placed in the predicament of being obliged to
hurry on the execution of them more rapidly than they had intended.
But still the authorities resolved once more to try the
effect of a proclamation, to <i>lull suspicion</i>. Having found themselves,
on several occasions, so successful in their art of duplicity,
they hoped still to catch the unwary foreigners in their net;
and there is some reason to believe they intended to take the
whole foreign community by <i>surprise</i>, and seize them in their
Factories, something after the fashion adopted by Commissioner
Lin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, fearful of being prematurely driven into the
exposure of their designs, the prefect thought proper to issue on
the 20th (only the day before the attack actually commenced) a
proclamation to the following effect, under his official seal. He
stated that "he issued this edict in order to <i>calm the feelings of
the merchants</i>, and to tranquillize commercial business." That
"it was to be feared that the merchants, seeing the gathering of
the military hosts, would tremble with alarm, not knowing where
these things would end." That, "instead of being frightened out
of their wits, so as to abandon their goods, and secretly go away,
they ought to be assured that the imperial commissioner and
general pacificator of the rebels, with the other higher officers,
would manage things with due consideration, so that the obedient
shall be protected from all injury, and their goods preserved in
safety." He concluded by saying, "that the foreign merchants
ought also to remain <i>quiet in their lawful pursuits</i>, continuing
their trade as usual, without alarm or suspicion."</p>

<p>All this in the face of incessant preparations, carried on day
and night, for the resumption of hostilities, and for the
treacherous annihilation of everything belonging to foreigners
within their grasp! and the <i>very day before</i> the explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>It was of course known to the authorities that our forces were
already moving up the river; their own plans, therefore, were
necessarily hastened, in the hope that by a simultaneous attack
by fire-rafts on our shipping at different points, as well as on the
Factories, they might get completely the upper hand of us before
our forces could be concentrated upon the city. Early in the
morning, therefore, Capt. Elliot recommended in strong terms,
that all foreigners should leave Canton before sunset.</p>

<p>During this whole day, the consternation among the Chinese
in the neighbourhood of the Factories, increased every hour;
shops were closed, goods removed, and several of our officers who
went on shore to see what was going on, were prevented by
guards of Chinese soldiers, from passing through any of the
usually frequented streets beyond the immediate proximity of the
Factories.</p>

<p>The crisis was now at its height. Many of the merchants had
withdrawn to Whampoa several days before, and in the course
of this day, all the rest (except two American gentlemen) got
away in boats. The small party of marines which were with
Capt. Elliot, in the British Factory, were withdrawn by orders of
Capt. Herbert, who had come up from Whampoa as commander
of the advanced squadron, and before sunset Capt. Elliot himself,
with his suite, once more abandoned the Factory, and came on
board the Nemesis. Capt. Herbert, however, removed on board
the Modeste. And now, the flag of England was finally lowered
at Canton, where it was never again hoisted until long after the
conclusion of peace.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Pylades and Modeste, together with the
Algerine, had been moved closer up to the town, for mutual protection.
The Nemesis still remained a little above the Factories,
together with the Louisa, Capt. Elliot's own cutter, and Mr. Dent's
schooner, the Aurora. A dull and ominous suspense reigned on
every side; a general stagnation of ordinary intercourse; and
that noble river, usually so busy with the hum of men, and, as it
were, alive with the innumerable boats of every shape and fashion
which ply upon its surface, and that active, busy, almost countless
population, which make their home upon its friendly waters, and
seem happy in their thrifty industry, all now were dull, and almost
still with a portentous dreariness.</p>

<p>The sun at length set gloomily. The darkness of the night
was remarkable; and one better adapted for surprising an enemy
could hardly have been chosen. But, although the precise nature
of their plans, or mode of attack was not known, yet enough had
been clearly ascertained to render every possible precaution
necessary. The Modeste lay somewhat higher up the river than
the Nemesis, and was likely to be the first to discover the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of an enemy in that quarter, whatever might be their
design.</p>

<p>On board the Nemesis no precaution was omitted; double
sentries were placed; the men below were all ordered to lie down
ready equipped for instant service; even the fires were laid and
<i>lighted</i> in the furnaces, so that steam could be got up in a few
minutes if requisite. All who could be spared retired to rest,
but not to sleep. The feeling of excitement was too general to
permit repose. Capt. Elliot laid himself down in his cloak upon
the quarter-deck, while Capt. Hall, ever on the alert, stretched
himself upon the bridge between the paddle-boxes, ready at a
second's warning to give the necessary orders. Capt. Herbert,
also, who was at that time on board the Modeste, had fully
impressed every one with the necessity of omitting no precaution
against the impending danger.</p>

<p>Equal activity and similar precautions were adopted on board
all the other ships, and already the Herald and Calliope had
been moved up the river, to within a short distance of Canton.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>The intense anxiety which took possession of every one's mind
at Canton, on the evening of the expected attack upon our
vessels by the Chinese, as described at the close of the last
chapter, has not by any means been exaggerated. The very uncertainty
of the plans of the Chinese served to increase the
interest felt, and the extreme darkness of the night gave the
greatest cause for apprehension of treachery.</p>

<p>During the early part of the evening complete stillness prevailed;
nothing whatever betokened an immediate attack. It
was about eleven o'clock when the alarm was given. One of the
sentries of the Modeste, which was a little in advance of the
other vessels,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> first discovered several large, dark-looking masses
dropping down with the stream. Being hailed by the sentry, the
Chinese who had charge of them immediately set fire to the
combustible materials which they contained. The flames, bursting
forth suddenly, spread the alarm, and pointed out the danger to
the other vessels, while it was still remote. There was a general
beat to quarters; steam was rapidly got up on board the Nemesis,
the fires having been lighted early in the evening; the anchor
was weighed, and, in the short space of <span class="smcap">NINE MINUTES</span> from the
time the alarm was given, the Nemesis was under weigh, and
under command of the helm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>The premature discovery of the design, <i>before</i> it was actually
commenced, disconcerted the plans of the Chinese, and caused
them to set fire to the rafts sooner than had been intended. The
derangement of a grand scheme at its outset embarrasses all the
subsequent details, and is apt to discourage all those who are
employed to carry them into execution. The moment they cease
to act in concert, the failure of every part of the scheme is certain.
Thus, on the present occasion, in consequence of some of the
fire-rafts being ignited too soon, the greater part of the rest were
not ignited at all; so that, out of the immense number, about a
hundred, which had been prepared, not above ten or a dozen
were set on fire or sent down against our vessels at Canton.
Some, however, were sent adrift against the Alligator, at anchor
near Howqua's Fort.</p>

<p>These fire-rafts were ingeniously constructed to effect their
object, being composed of boats chained together in twos and
threes, so that, drifting down with the stream, they might hang
across the bows of a ship, so as not to be easily got clear. They
were filled with all kinds of combustible materials. Numerous
junks and smaller boats were barely seen in the distance higher
up the river, said to have a large body of troops on board, for
the purpose of trying to board our ships during the confusion
which it was expected would take place. But the moment they
found that they were likely to meet with a warm reception, they
did their best to get away again as fast as they could.</p>

<p>The Nemesis ran up at full speed towards the fire-rafts, in
order to assist the boats of the squadron in towing them away.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Many of them, however, drifted fairly on shore, and set fire to the
suburbs of the town, causing much greater alarm to the Chinese
than they did to those whom they were designed to annihilate.
It was a grand spectacle, in the sullen darkness of the night, to
see these floating masses of fire drifting about the river, and
shewing, by their own reflected light, the panic-stricken parties
of Chinese who had charge of them, trying to escape towards
the shore, which few of them were destined to reach. Some
threw themselves overboard, were carried down the stream, and
their struggles were soon ended; others were shot at random by
our musketry, the moment they were discovered by our men,
betrayed by the light of the fires they had themselves kindled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>So far the Chinese scheme proved a total failure. Nor was the
attempt more successful upon the Alligator, off Howqua's Fort.
The attack was to have been simultaneously made upon all our
ships in different parts of the river, both at Whampoa and at the
Bogue; but, owing to some error, or more probably, the premature
explosion of their plan at Canton, the attack on the Wellesley,
at the Bogue, did not take place until nearly midnight of the
24th, three days afterwards. It was, however, well concerted, and
very formidable, as it comprised a flotilla of little less than
twenty vessels, chained in twos and threes; many of these had
gunpowder as well as other combustibles on board. It was not
without great exertion of Commander Fletcher and the few officers
and men remaining on board (most of them being absent on
service under Capt. Maitland, with the advanced squadron) that
they were towed clear of the ship, by the only three boats she
had left. In no instance was any damage done to our ships.</p>

<p>But the plan of the Chinese was not limited to their exploits
with fire-rafts. The new batteries before spoken of, as having
been erected by Yih-shan, just above Canton, towards the river
side, opened a heavy fire upon our ships, just when it was
imagined they would have been embarrassed by the fire-vessels.
The artillery now began to roar on both sides, although, owing
to the midnight darkness, it was solely directed by the flashing
of each others guns.</p>

<p>The Nemesis had now run so close in shore, that she was able
clearly to distinguish, by the light of the batteries and the reflection
of the fire in the suburbs, the different Tartar officers rallying
and encouraging their men to fight the guns. The two small
vessels which lay off the Factories (the Louisa and Aurora) were
at one time in imminent danger, as the Chinese had actually
brought down to the river side a very large gun, and planted it
within good range, to blow them out of the water. They could
not be moved until the tide turned; but, by alternately veering
out cable and shortening it in again, so as to alter the range and
balk the Chinese gunners during the darkness, they managed to
escape with trifling damage. In the morning they were moved
out of danger with the turn of tide. At intervals, the firing was
kept up until daylight.</p>

<p>At length, the sun rose brightly upon the scene of midnight
encounter; and now, the wrecks of the still burning fire-vessels,
the crumbling batteries on shore, the suburbs of the town in
flames, the deserted river, and some trifling damages on board
one or two of our own vessels, bore witness to what had happened.</p>

<p>The attack upon the Shameen battery was now renewed, and it
was soon silenced by the fire of the vessels. A few shot and
shell were thrown into the adjoining suburbs, where the fire had
broken out; but some of the Chinese soldiers, who had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
abandoned their guns, when they found that our men did not land
immediately to take possession of the works, actually returned and
fired another round or two from the Shameen battery. They
were soon, however, driven out, and eight fine large brass guns
were captured.</p>

<p>It was during these operations at Canton, that Capt. Elliot and
Capt. Herbert narrowly escaped a very dangerous accident, which
might have proved fatal to many, had it not been fortunately
averted by the personal coolness and resolution of the captain of
the Nemesis. A Congreve rocket, which had been placed in the
proper tube from which it is fired, and had been already ignited,
accidentally hung within it, instead of being projected, as intended.
In another second it would have burst in the tube itself, and must
have killed or wounded all those who were standing near it upon
the bridge between the paddle-boxes. With instant coolness and
presence of mind, Capt. Hall put his arm into the tube and
forcibly pushed it out from behind, although the rush of fire
which came out of it burnt his hand severely and caused intense
pain. Indeed, it was not done without great personal risk. It
is difficult to calculate what disastrous results might not have
followed, had the rocket burst in the tube, on board ship.</p>

<p>Just when all opposition at the Shameen battery had been
overcome, an unlooked-for opportunity occurred of rendering
signal service, by the discovery of the principal rendezvous of
all the fire-rafts and men-of-war junks, whose place of retreat
had hitherto been concealed. Every fresh report had confirmed
the previous information that preparations of an extensive kind
had been made by the Chinese higher up the river, but it was
supposed to be at some place much more distant than was now
found to be the case. The first thing which led to the discovery
was the suspicious appearance of a large war-junk, which suddenly
came out from behind a point of land some way above the
fort. Having fired one or two distant shots, she again withdrew
out of sight.</p>

<p>The Nemesis instantly proceeded in search of the expected
prize, under the orders of Captain Herbert, who was on board.
The junk again stole out from her hiding-place, but, the moment
she observed the steamer coming towards her, she made off in
all haste up a large creek, which turned round to the northward.
About a mile or less within this passage, the whole Chinese fleet
of war-junks, fire-rafts, boats, &amp;c., was suddenly descried, to the
number, probably, of more than a hundred.</p>

<p>This was an exciting moment. The Chinese were thrown
into the utmost consternation by the sudden approach of the
steamer; and the more numerous were the junks and craft of all
kinds, the greater was the confusion into which they were thrown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Every shot now told upon the confused mass. The Chinese ran
most of their boats ashore, in order to make their own escape;
others tried to make their way up the creek, each one striving to
pass the other. Suddenly a small masked battery opened fire
upon the steamer; but a few round shot, followed by grape,
drove the Chinese from their guns, and served to disperse a
small body of troops, who were drawn up in the rear. The
water soon became too shallow for the steamer to proceed further,
and she, therefore, came to anchor.</p>

<p>Some boats from the Calliope and Herald and other vessels
now joined, and, together with the boats of the Nemesis, continued
the pursuit, and destroyed or run ashore an immense
number of junks, fire-rafts, and fishing-boats of every kind.</p>

<p>About fifty boats were found filled with combustibles, and were
joined eight or nine together, having been destined to drift
down with the tide upon our vessels. Many of the junks had
troops on board, from distant parts of the empire, intended for
the relief of the city.</p>

<p>The scene was extremely animating; numbers of the Chinese
were scrambling ashore, or clinging to fragments of their boats
or spars, as they floated about in the water. Some of the junks
were burnt, and others blown up, but the precaution was taken
to examine carefully every one of them before it was set on fire,
in order to rescue any of the panic-stricken Chinese who might
be trying to find concealment in it. But, in spite of this precaution,
the structure of the junks afforded so many little hiding
places for the terrified Chinese, that, as the fires gradually burnt
more briskly, and took more certain effect upon the vessels,
several poor fellows were observed to rush up from below, and
then, unable to support the heat upon deck, to jump desperately
overboard. Some of these swam easily on shore; others, who
could not swim, remained clinging to the outside of the junk, or
to the rudder, until the heat became insupportable, or the vessel
itself blew up. In this way, some few necessarily perished, for
it was not possible to save them all, owing to the small number
of boats employed on our side, and the large number of those
destroyed on theirs; besides which, the heat and danger were
often too great to be able to approach near enough to render
timely assistance.</p>

<p>Thus, in the short space of three hours, forty-three war-junks
were blown up, and thirty-two fire-rafts destroyed, besides smaller
boats. Some which had been run ashore were left untouched.</p>

<p>This important encounter produced one very valuable result,
as it led to the discovery of the most desirable landing-place for
our troops, in the projected attack on the heights of Canton.
This spot was distinctly seen and remarked upon by the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
officers on board the Nemesis, and was particularly noticed by
Captain Herbert, in his report of this affair to Sir Le Fleming
Senhouse, written on the very same day. This is not a matter
of slight moment, because all allusion to this circumstance was
omitted in the public despatch of Sir Le Fleming Senhouse. In
Captain Herbert's report, dated on the 22nd of May, on board
the Nemesis, that officer, after having described the destruction
of the numerous boats and fire-rafts, distinctly said:&mdash;"Their
wrecks are lining both banks of the river nearly close up to
Tsingpoo, <i>the landing-place</i>, from which a good approach appears
to lead direct to the north gate of the city wall, not more than
four miles distant, with <i>dry footing</i> the whole way." He also
intimated that artillery might probably be brought there. Moreover,
while Captain Hall was lying in bed with pain and fever
from his disabled hand, the general himself and other officers
subsequently came down into his cabin, purposely to make
inquiry concerning the landing-place and the country about it,
such as it had been seen from the Nemesis.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 23rd, the Sulphur, under Captain
Belcher, having with him the Druid's launch, and several other
boats, proceeded into the same creek in which Captain Herbert
had found the landing-place the day before, and destroyed one or
two junks and rafts which had been left the previous day, and
some others which had returned after their first escape. Five
junks and thirteen small boats were destroyed. The practicable
landing-place at Tsingpoo was also reported on by that officer,
and he added that he got himself hoisted up to the mast-head of
a junk, sextant in hand, to get a look at the country, and
observed the enemy encamped on the verge of a hill, but that he
"<i>had not the slightest doubt</i> that they would have fled, had he
advanced towards the hill." As it was, however, he was content
with landing at the temple at Tsingpoo, and, throwing into the
river the five guns of the little masked battery which had opened
on the Nemesis the day before, and had been silenced by her
fire, but which Captain Herbert had not thought it worth his
while to destroy, as the war-junks and fire-rafts claimed his more
immediate attention.</p>

<p>Captain Belcher hastened down to the Blenheim the same
evening, and reported what he had done to Sir Le Fleming Senhouse,
"who," he says, (see Voyage of the Sulphur, p. 184 to
187,) "had been sitting up for him, and <i>seemed delighted beyond
measure at what he heard</i>."</p>

<p>To return to the Nemesis, as she came back towards the Factories,
from the scene of her exploits at Tsingpoo on the previous
day. The remarks of a gentleman who was at Canton at the
time are curious enough. Speaking of what occurred, he says:&mdash;"From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
time to time loud explosions were heard in that direction
[Tsingpoo]; dense volumes of smoke rose up continually,
both black and white, and announced some terrible work of
destruction. After some time a general cheer burst forth from
all those who were near me, as the Nemesis came in sight, just
rounding the corner on her return, towing several boats after
her towards the Macao passage. It was an interesting and even
ludicrous sight, as she approached, to observe the boats, as well
as the vessel itself, decked out with Chinese flags, the men
exhibiting their trophies with evident pride, some rigged out in
every variety of Chinese dress, from mandarins downwards;
some with Chinese caps, and others with Chinese tails, with
which a whole boat's crew were decorated. It appears that,
when they took prisoners, they merely cut off their tails, (a mark
of deep disgrace to a Chinaman,) and let them go again about
their business."</p>

<p>But the day was by no means ended yet; and, indeed, the
business had commenced so early, (at dawn,) that even at this
time it was little more than eight o'clock. And now comes a
scene of a very different kind. I have before stated, that the
guard of marines had been withdrawn from the Factory, and the
flag struck on the previous day. A vast quantity of property
had already been removed, but much still remained, of considerable
value, and much more was supposed to be left behind of
still greater importance. All this became an object of longing
to the mob, to say nothing of any natural feeling of hostility,
which was ready to vent itself upon something or other. Pillage
now became the order of the day. It is said even that a party of
Chinese soldiers were first sent down <i>expressly</i> to search for
arms. Of these they found none; but there were still enough
of other things to tempt their avarice. They had certainly the
first choice of the booty, although the general mob speedily
joined in the general ransack. Several of the officers, or low
mandarins, were seen to be quite as busy as the rest of the
people, some even carrying away plunder upon their horses, and
others who had none sending for them on purpose.</p>

<p>Readers who can picture to themselves the long, gloomy labyrinths
of passages, and alleys, and staircases, which are comprised
within the piles of buildings called the Factories, can well
imagine the terrible scene of riot, destruction, and pillage, which
was going on; yet, probably, not worse than would have been
committed by an English mob under similar circumstances; as
Bristol, Birmingham, and other places can testify. There was a
reckless destruction of property which could not be removed,
even after every article of furniture as well as merchandise had
been carried away. Doors and windows were soon disposed of,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and the very staircases and stone floorings were broken up and
destroyed.</p>

<p>In the Old Company's or British Factory, the confusion was
most terrible, because in it there remained a greater number of
valuable objects to destroy. The beautiful chandeliers and fine
looking-glasses were soon annihilated and carried off piecemeal;
and the noble large marble statue which stood in the great hall
served as an object of especial vengeance, as if it contained
within itself the very germs or symbols of all the barbarian
nations of the earth, and could communicate to them a portion
of the insults now heaped upon it as it lay prostrate in the hall.</p>

<p>During the whole day, the same mad scene of destruction was
continued; and whatever still defied the hands of the infuriate
mob was at length made to yield to the consuming power of fire.
Not all the thirteen Hongs, however, were visited with this terrible
pillage; many of them escaped altogether, which is somewhat
remarkable; but all those situated between the limits of
Hog Lane and a small creek which runs into the river at the
other end, were entirely destroyed, except the bare walls. Within
this space were included the British, together with the Dutch and
the Creek Factories, a very fine and extensive range of handsome
buildings.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the day, when the work of destruction
was nearly completed, down came, at length, the prefect of the
city in person, attended by a large party of police. He now
succeeded in driving away the main body of the mob, and then
gave charge of the Factories to the Hong merchants, to whom all
the buildings belonged, and who took possession of the little
that remained, with the assistance of a number of their own hired
labourers, armed for the occasion.</p>

<p>The account given of this day's proceedings by a highly respectable
American merchant, who imprudently remained behind
the night before, is extremely valuable. Without going into
minute details, it will suffice to mention, that Mr. Coolidge was
taken prisoner, after being in great danger of being cut down,
and was, with many insults, carried into the heart of the city.
As he was marched along, he passed several bodies of soldiers
and coolies, or day-labourers, hurrying down towards the Factories,
and dragging guns along with them. As soon as he
came near the head-quarters of the Tartar general, the crowd
and movement increased; officers of every grade, grooms and
messengers on horseback, hurrying to and fro, executioners and
city-guards, together with strange troops from distant provinces,
in every variety of costume&mdash;these were all huddled together, and
jostled in the greatest bustle and confusion.</p>

<p>After some delay, he was carried, with every possible insult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
before the criminal judge, and there, to his horror, he discovered
several of his countrymen, who had been wounded and captured
as they were trying to escape in a boat down the river. The
sufferings and indignities they now underwent were extreme;
nor did their assertion, that they were Americans, prove of much
service to them, for they were told that, in that case, they
"<i>ought to speak a different language, and wear a different dress</i>."</p>

<p>It is very certain, however, that the Chinese generally at
Canton know perfectly well the difference between an American
and an Englishman, politically. But, on the other hand, when
an Englishman gets into trouble there, he most commonly
declares himself to be an American; and how could the Chinese
prove that he is not so? But the national distinction is perfectly
well defined, even in their own language, as is commonly
known; the Americans being called the "people of the flowery
flag," from the number of stars on it, while the English were
known as the "red people," or "red-haired people," an appellation
originally applied to the Dutch traders.</p>

<p>The American prisoners remained in the condition I have
described, exposed to every possible suffering in the common
prison, for nearly two days, when they were at length turned
out, and carried in chairs to the ruined Factories, where they were
<i>planted</i> among the ruins, just as if they had been portions of the
marble statue which had been destroyed.</p>

<p>It was just at this time that our troops landed&mdash;namely, the
Cameronians, under Major Pratt, (as will be presently seen,)&mdash;and,
of course, every attention was paid to the unhappy sufferers;
and, as Mr. Coolidge observes, "I cannot tell you with what
feelings of good-will we looked upon every one of those redcoats."</p>

<p>Soon after mid-day, while the work of destruction was going
on at the Factories, Captain Elliot and Captain Herbert proceeded
with all speed down to Whampoa, in order to make arrangements
for the hasty advance of the whole force, which was nearly
all there assembled, not far from Whampoa. Captain Elliot,
however, could not forego the pleasure of giving a parting proclamation
to the Chinese, even then. He told the people of
Canton, "that their city had twice been <i>spared</i>, but that his
agreement with the three commissioners had now been violated
by them, by the arming of their forts, and by their secret preparations
to attack the English, who were <i>the real protectors of the
city</i>." He called upon them "to remember the hour of battle,
and to consider whether the troops of the other provinces now
among them were not the real scourges of the inhabitants;"
and, after a little more in the same compassionate strain, he
wound up by calling upon them "<i>to turn out the commissioners</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
<i>and their troops</i> from the city <i>within twelve hours</i>, otherwise that
the English would be obliged to withdraw their <i>protection</i> from
the city, and take military possession of it, confiscating all the
property to the Queen of England."</p>

<p>This must have sounded highly gratifying to the Chinese;
quite in the Oriental style; and it was exceedingly probable that
the mob of Canton would have the power, even had they the
will, to turn out about twenty thousand troops, together with the
high authorities, all in the twinkling of an eye, by a sort of talismanic
"Open sesame!"</p>

<p>The storm was now gathering thicker and thicker every hour;
our forces were all by this time concentrated within a few short
miles of the city; delay was no longer possible; and the moment
appeared inevitably come, though long delayed, when the Chinese
authorities must yield to force, where "reason" and negotiation
had been tried in vain, and written instruments had failed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>A few remarks upon the city and neighbourhood of Canton,
before which our troops are now for the first time about to
appear, (the previous operations of the 18th March having been
entirely limited to the naval forces,) will contribute to the interest
of the subsequent narrative. The city of Canton, or Kwantung,
is situated upon the northern bank of the river usually known by
the same name, though sometimes called by Europeans the Pearl
river, from its Chinese name, Choo-keang. Its distance from
the Bogue is about forty miles.</p>

<p>The scenery around the city is extremely diversified. On the
northern and north-eastern sides it is commanded by hills, the
possession of which by an enemy must, of necessity, place the
city at his mercy. In other directions it presents the aspect of
a low and abundantly-watered plain, cut up by canals and little
rivers, which serve both for irrigation and for communication
with the interior. So numerous are they, that in some parts
nearly a third part of the whole surface is occupied by water.
The appearance of the country is rich, and at most seasons beautifully
green, being divided into rice-fields and little gardens,
with here and there a clump of trees or a small village, or the
country residences of some of the wealthier inhabitants of the
city, to diversify the prospect.</p>

<p>About three or four miles to the westward of the city, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
curving round at the foot of the hills which command it, runs
the creek or river in which the war-junks and fire-rafts had been
destroyed by the Nemesis and boats. The excellent landing-place
at Tsingpoo, which had been discovered on that occasion,
was very conveniently situated for the debarkation of troops
destined to attack the heights above the city, which are in fact
the key to its occupation.</p>

<p>The city and its suburbs occupy the whole space between the
hills and the river; the suburbs, however, being little less extensive
than the city itself. The latter is surrounded by a high
wall, which has twelve entrances, and it may be about six or
seven miles in circumference. On the south, or river side, a
portion of the suburbs extends down to the water-side; and in
the western corner of these are situated the foreign factories, and
the principal packhouses of the Hong merchants, which are
partly built on piles on the river's bank. On the northern side,
the wall rests directly upon the brow of the hills; and, indeed,
there is a hill of moderate elevation actually <i>within the walls</i>, the
possession of which would, in fact, give the command of the
entire city, and which could have been held by a small force
against any troops the Chinese could bring against it. Another
wall divides the city into two unequal parts, running from east
to west, and called the Old and the New City, the latter being
much more modern than the former, but differing from it very
little in appearance. The residences of all the high officers, the
Viceroy, Lieutenant-Governor, Tartar General, and others, together
with a public arsenal, are situated in the Old City; but
the moment we got possession of the two forts, called the Dutch
and French Follies, we could command the whole of these places,
without in any degree endangering the Factories, which are at a
considerable distance to the westward, in the suburbs.</p>

<p>The heights above the city were crowned with four strong
forts, built principally of brick at the upper part, but of stone
below. They mounted altogether forty-two guns of various
calibre, together with a great number of ginjals and wall-pieces.
Between them and the city walls, the distance of which varied
from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty paces, there
was an irregular, and in some parts deep and broken ravine.
The hill before described as <i>within</i> the circuit of the walls was
also within range of the heights; and so important was this
position afterwards considered by Sir Hugh Gough, that he distinctly
declared that, with "this in his possession, he would have
been responsible that the city should have been spared, and that
not a soldier should have entered the town farther than this
fortified height."</p>

<p>With these few preliminary observations, we may now return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to the point at which our combined naval and military forces
were all concentrated, below Whampoa, on the 22nd and 23rd of
March, having sailed from Hong-Kong on the 18th and 19th of
that month.</p>

<p>An important general order was now issued by Sir Hugh
Gough, preparatory to the advance of our troops upon Canton.
It betokened the true feeling which animated the expedition;
and, while it goes far to refute the belief that wanton cruelty was
inflicted upon the Chinese, it does honour to the expedition, as
<i>primâ facie</i> evidence of the forbearance with which our power
was exercised. After first alluding to the novelty of the Chinese
system of warfare to the British soldier, as one making up in
cunning and artifice what it lacks in discipline, and, after recommending
extreme caution against surprise and stratagem, and,
above all, the observance of the strictest discipline, Sir Hugh
Gough proceeds to remind his soldiers that "Great Britain had
gained as much fame by her clemency and forbearance as by
the gallantry of her troops. An enemy in arms is always a
legitimate foe; but the unarmed, or the supplicant for mercy, of
whatever country or whatever colour, a true British soldier will
always spare." Such was in reality the feeling which animated
the whole expedition, although the desultory attacks of the
Chinese, and the refusal of many of them to surrender when all
further resistance was useless, sometimes occasioned a loss of
life which was to be deplored, but which could not be prevented.</p>

<p>The channel through which our forces were now about to
advance upon Canton was one which had been not long before
examined for the first time, one may even say discovered, by
Mr. Browne, the master of the Calliope; Lieut. Kellett, of the
Starling; Mr. Johnson, the master of the Conway, and other
officers. It came to be called Browne's Passage, although Mr.
Browne himself called it the "main branch of the Canton river."
It runs to the southward of French Island, towards the Macao
passage, and is a much more important branch of the river than
that which runs along the northern side of that island, which was
first explored in the Nemesis by Captain Herbert and Captain
Elliot, and along which our vessels had proceeded to the attack
of the Macao Fort, as before described.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In Captain Herbert's report to Sir Gordon Bremer, in the
middle of March, referring to some of these passages, he stated
that "boats from the Calliope, Herald, Hyacinth, Sulphur, and
Starling, had, on several occasions, explored the channels in the
south branch of the river, from Danes' Island upwards, and that
they had found a safe and deep passage for vessels drawing
sixteen feet water up to the city of Canton, except two bars,
which it required high water to pass." Mr. Browne and Lieut.
Kellett, with the boats, had proceeded along the channel between
Danes' and French Islands, and then entered the passage, which
runs along the southern side of the latter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chinese had commenced preparations for the defence of
these channels at several points; there was a battery of ten guns,
another of fourteen, and one of four guns, in the passage between
the two islands, or French River, which was too small for ships
to pass through it. Other batteries were also found in the so-called
Browne's Passage, one of which was calculated to mount
thirty-seven guns. Indeed, in all the branches of the river, batteries
were found, some partially, some completely, finished. At
one of these, a little above the last mentioned, there were not
less than forty guns ready for mounting, newly cast, and with
quite new carriages. But the Chinese offered no resistance;
and, on one occasion, Lieutenant Kellett invited the mandarin in
charge of one of these forts to come and breakfast with him,
presuming that he had more appetite for food than for fighting.</p>

<p>Mr. Browne and Mr. Johnson made a good rough survey of
the whole of this important channel, in which there was found
to be depth of water sufficient for our largest transports, to the
distance of about ten miles. Even a line-of-battle ship, the
Blenheim, was carried up nearly as far as the transports; and
hence the beginning of the passage along the southern bank of
Danes' Island obtained the name of the Blenheim Reach. It is
here that our largest merchant ships have since usually anchored.</p>

<p>The 23rd of May was occupied in completing the necessary
preparations for the conveyance of our troops, marines, small-arm
men, and camp-followers, up to the city of Canton; but it
was not until noon of the 24th that our forces could commence
their advance. In the meantime, Captain Belcher had been directed
to collect as many Chinese boats as possible higher up the
river, and to send them down with the tide. Gradually they had
been dropping down from the direction of the city, until, at
length, there were enough collected for the conveyance of two
thousand men, besides camp-followers, stores, and matériel of all
kinds. At the same time, with a view to embarrass the Chinese
as much as possible, orders had been given that all the native
trading-boats should be detained, and that all the salt-junks
should be stopped. In the course of a few days, no less than
one hundred and forty-one trading-junks, of every description,
were brought-to, and detained in the neighbourhood of Napier's
Fort, and at the Naval Arsenal below the city; they comprised
little less than ten thousand tons of shipping, manned by about
one thousand one hundred Chinese sailors. The sudden stoppage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of this considerable trade could not fail to make a deep
impression upon the whole people of Canton. No injury, however,
was done to any of the trading-vessels, which were all
suffered to depart without further molestation, the moment the
authorities of the city had agreed to Captain Elliot's terms.</p>

<p>Before our troops finally advanced upon Canton, Sir Hugh
Gough and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse went up in person, to
make a careful reconnoissance, and particularly with a view to
assure themselves of the practicability of the landing-place at
Tsingpoo.</p>

<p>At length, soon after noon on the 24th, every preparation for
the advance was completed.</p>

<p>The troops were all embarked in two columns, of which the
right was destined to hold the Factories, and was taken up in the
Atalanta steamer. It merely consisted of the 26th Cameronians,
less than three hundred strong, together with an officer and
twenty men of the Madras Artillery, with one six-pounder gun,
and one five and a half-inch mortar. Thirty sappers, with an
officer of engineers, were also attached to it; it was under the
command of Major Pratt, of the 26th regiment. The left column
comprised the main body of the force, which was destined to
carry the heights above the city, being divided into four brigades.
An account of these will be given in its proper place.</p>

<p>To the Nemesis was entrusted the charge and the honour of
carrying or towing up the whole of this column, together with
the camp-followers and attendants of every description, (in this
instance reduced to the smallest possible number,) which always
accompany our troops in the East. The enormous flotilla of
boats, including, of course, those belonging to the men-of-war,
necessarily retarded the progress of the steamer very much, particularly
in the more intricate parts of the river. As she advanced,
numerous boats from our ships were picked up, until their number
could not have been less than from seventy to eighty; hanging
on behind each other, and following in the wake of the long,
low steamer. It was altogether a very animating scene. The
numerous flags, the motley appearance of the boats, the glitter
of the arms and accoutrements, and the various uniforms of the
men, produced a very exciting spectacle.</p>

<p>On board the Nemesis were the 49th regiment; together with
Major-General Sir Hugh Gough and his staff, Sir Le Fleming
Senhouse, and Captain Elliot, accompanied by Mr. Morrison.
Captain Bourchier, who was to command the naval brigade, and
several other officers, were also on board. The decks of the
steamer were crowded. Slowly and steadily she advanced,
dragging after her the long tail of boats, a more numerous
flotilla than any steamer had yet towed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese must have been perfectly well informed of the
approach of the force; and, had they not been already panic-struck
by the lessons they had so recently received, they might
have occasioned great annoyance, and perhaps loss, to our troops,
exposed as they were in boats, by firing on them from the banks
of the river, in places were they would have been themselves
under cover. No opposition of any kind, however, was offered.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Atalanta reached her destination at the
factories more expeditiously, and the right column was landed
before five o'clock, without opposition; when Major Pratt immediately
set about strengthening his post, and making the
necessary dispositions, either for defensive or offensive operations,
as circumstances might require.</p>

<p>It was now that the unfortunate Americans were discovered, in
the wretched plight before described, in the midst of the ruins of
the factories, in which they had been turned loose, as it were, like
beasts, after the indignities they had suffered.</p>

<p>It was just dusk when the left column, towed by the Nemesis,
reached the destined point of debarkation at Tsingpoo, where
the Sulphur was already at anchor. By this time it was too late
in the day to do more than land the 49th regiment. This was
easily effected, as they could walk on shore directly out of the
steamer, without the necessity of using boats, or causing any
delay whatever. Here, again, as in so many other instances, the
advantage of this description of steamer was clearly shewn.</p>

<p>During the rest of the evening of the 24th, and in the night,
the guns, ammunition, and stores were also landed, but the
remainder of the force did not disembark until the following
morning. As soon as the 49th were landed, they took possession
of a large temple, or so called joss-house, near the landing-place.
The general lost no time in making an extended reconnoissance
as soon as he had landed, under an escort of the 49th.</p>

<p>From a rising ground at no great distance, a general view of
the enemy's positions could be gained. It was now evident that
they had already taken the alarm, and they threw up some of
their small harmless rockets by way of signal, to shew that they
were on the alert, but made no movement in advance. Sir Hugh
Gough was in reality at this time perfectly unacquainted with
the nature of the country he would have to pass over on the following
day, as well as of the difficulties he might have to encounter;
but, with the utmost confidence in the steadiness and
perfect discipline of the little force under his command, he felt
assured that no difficulties could check them. Neither could the
amount of the enemy's force be at all ascertained, respecting
which there were various conjectures, probably in most instances
exaggerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese system of warfare had not yet been experienced
and it was, in fact, the first time that European troops were
about to undertake operations in China, beyond the cover of our
ships. The Chinese had been known to declare that, if they
could get us away from our ships, they had full confidence that
they would be able to beat us in fair fight ashore. They were
now soon to have an opportunity of putting their prowess to the
test. This was the first occasion on which a British general
officer had commanded in China; and it was the first opportunity
which that general had ever had of witnessing the gallantry
of British seamen and marines in service on shore, and of bearing
testimony to their steadiness and discipline, and to the value
of their co-operation. He afterwards expressed himself in general
orders, in reference to the naval brigade under Captain Bourchier,
to the effect "that it would always be a matter of proud recollection
to him that he had had them under his orders."</p>

<p>While our troops had thus advanced upon Canton on the 24th,
Captain Herbert, who was stationed at Whampoa with the
Calliope, Conway, Herald, and Alligator, was directed to push
up the river with the flood-tide, with such vessels as could proceed,
or with the boats of the ships, by the direct, or Whampoa
passage, and endeavour to secure the naval arsenal opposite the
city. It was left to his own judgment to attack the French fort
below the city, or not, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>At the same time, another part of our force, consisting of the
Hyacinth, Modeste, Cruiser, and Columbine, had taken up a
position near the factories, under Captain Warren, who had
been directed to secure the Dutch fort, and to use his own
judgment as to an attack upon any other of the defences which
were known to have been recently constructed. The possession
of the Dutch and French forts would give us complete command
of the river front of the city, and of the palaces of the high
authorities.</p>

<p>Captain Herbert lost no time in pushing up the river, with
the boats and marines of the ships before mentioned; while
Captain Warren, having ordered the Nimrod and Pylades to
attack the Shameen Fort, (which had been re-armed by the
Chinese) proceeded to place the Hyacinth, under his own command,
abreast of the factories, in order to cover the landing of
the 26th regiment from the Atalanta.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Modeste, Cruiser, and Columbine, took
up a position to attack the Dutch Folly if necessary; but it was
found to be unarmed.</p>

<p>As soon as the 26th regiment had landed at the factory, the
Atalanta and Algerine (which had now joined the squadron)
were ordered to move down the river as far as possible. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Atalanta unfortunately took the ground, where she remained for
several days, and was got off with difficulty. The Algerine,
drawing but little water, was able to go over the reef, which is
abreast of the Dutch fort, with a strong ebb-tide. She then took
up her berth between the Dutch and French Follies, and only one
hundred and fifty yards distant from a heavy sand battery, which
she engaged single-handed, none of the other vessels being able
to come up to her support. The battery mounted eleven very
heavy guns, and the Algerine was frequently hit. The pinnaces
of the Hyacinth and Modeste were sent to help to shift her berth,
but this was impossible, owing to the strength of the tide.
Lieutenant Mason, who commanded the brig, with instant
determination now pushed off in his gig, and, accompanied by
the two pinnaces, dashed ashore and carried the battery with
great gallantry, but not without meeting with strong resistance,
in which Mr. Fitzgerald, of the Modeste, fell mortally wounded,
together with one seaman killed, and fourteen seamen and
marines wounded. Some of the Chinese guns were ten and a
half inch.</p>

<p>Captain Herbert and Captain Bethune endeavoured to push
up from Howqua's Folly at sunset, but were stopped by a shot
from the French Folly, which went through Captain Herbert's
boat, and the heaviness of the fire compelled the boats to take
shelter under a point of land for some hours, so that they were
not able to reach the brig until two o'clock, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> During the
night several fire-rafts were sent adrift, but were towed clear
without doing any mischief. Thus ended the 24th of May, and
our forces, both naval and military, might already be said to hold
Canton at their mercy.</p>

<p>A few words more will suffice to complete the description of
all the naval operations before Canton, before we turn to the
military part of them.</p>

<p>No time was lost on the following morning in securing the
arsenal, in which were found nearly a dozen large war-junks
upon the stocks, and a great many row boats. There were also
twelve large war-junks just finished, lying at anchor off the
arsenal.</p>

<p>Having, made a reconnoissance of the French fort, and the
other defences on that side, Captain Herbert resolved to carry it
without loss of time. The Modeste was the only vessel except
the Algerine which could be got across the bar at the Dutch
Folly, and that not without great difficulty, having been warped
over the reef at high water. The Atalanta was still aground;
and the guns of the Algerine not being sufficiently heavy, Captain
Herbert ordered shell-guns to be fitted in three of the captured
war-junks, to assist in the attack upon the French Folly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The gun-junks were placed under the direction of Lieutenants
Haskell and Hay, and, together with the Modeste and Algerine,
opened upon the French fort and the long line of works connected
with it on the morning of the 26th. The Chinese soon
began to give way, and Captain Bethune immediately landed
with the storming party, and gallantly carried the works. There
were altogether sixty-four guns, some of large calibre, four being
ten and a half inch. Thus the whole of the river defences of
Canton were at length in our possession, at the same time that
the heights above the city had been carried by our troops under
Sir Hugh Gough, as will be next described.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>It will be remembered that the twenty-sixth regiment, together
with a few of the Madras artillery, and sappers and miners
were posted at the Factories, and, therefore, took no part in the
engagements on the heights on the 25th, although they joined
the head-quarters afterwards. The whole force actually engaged
on that day, under Sir Hugh Gough, including the marines and the
naval brigade, amounted to very nearly two thousand four hundred
men. But the actual number of bayonets in the field was
only about one thousand five hundred. The artillery comprised
a body of four hundred men, with four 12-pounder howitzers,
four 9-pounder field-guns, and two 6-pounder guns; also three
five and a half inch mortars, and one hundred and fifty-two
32-pounder rockets.</p>

<p>The naval brigade, commanded by Captain Bourchier, comprised
four hundred and three small-arm men; so that, when
added to the marines, it is evident that full one-third of the
force employed on the heights was supplied by the different
ships of the squadron&mdash;viz., eight hundred and eleven men.
In proportion as these were withdrawn from their respective
ships, the duty to be performed by those who remained on
board became the more severe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Le Fleming Senhouse entrusted the command of the
naval brigade to Captain Bourchier, as it was the express
wish of Sir Hugh Gough that the senior naval officer should
join his staff, and remain at his side throughout the day,
instead of leading the brigade in person. It was divided into
two battalions, one led by Captain Maitland of the Wellesley,
and the other by Commander Barlow of the Nimrod. The
whole force was divided into four brigades, and was directed
to move left in front. The details given below will render
further comment unnecessary.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>At daylight, on the morning of the 25th, the whole of the
troops were landed. The Nemesis, Sulphur, and Starling,
remained at anchor close to Tsingpoo; and small detachments
of the 18th and 49th regiments, and of the 37th M.N.I.,
amounting altogether to between seventy and eighty men,
were left posted at the temple before described, in order to
secure the landing, and prevent any attempt at surprise on the
part of the Chinese. This precaution afterwards proved to
have been very judicious.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>From a hill a little above the landing-place, a good view
of the enemy's positions could be obtained; and, a little
beyond that, a line of hills led directly up towards the rear of
the forts above the city, at the distance of between three and
four miles. The ground was irregular, and much broken by
hollows, partially cultivated and laid out in rice-grounds.
The labour of dragging the guns was, therefore, very great;
and, indeed, two of the twelve-pounder howitzers, and two of
the nine-pounder guns, were not got into position upon the
heights until the following day. The other two, however,
and also the six-pounders, together with the rocket-battery,
were brought up with the troops.</p>

<p>Of the four forts, two were situated not far from each other,
near the north-western angle of the city walls, on which side
is the hill which is enclosed <i>within</i> the walls, and which, in
the event of the capture of the city itself, it was the intention
of Sir Hugh Gough to occupy strongly, as being the key to
the possession of the whole city. The other two forts, which
might be called the eastern forts, were situated upon the
heights, at some distance to the eastward of the other forts,
nearly facing the centre of the city wall. One of these was
some way in advance of the other.</p>

<p>The weather was extremely sultry during the whole of the
25th, which much fatigued the men before the close of the
day, and laid the foundation for sickness, to which many
afterwards fell victims. The troops were directed to advance
along the brow of the hills in echelon of columns; and, as
soon as the artillery could be got up, the guns opened upon
the two western forts which were nearest, and from which the
Chinese had already commenced a spirited fire. They also
threatened an attack upon the right, by large columns, which
appeared to debouch from the western suburbs.</p>

<p>Our attack upon the two western forts was entrusted
entirely to the naval brigade, under cover of the guns and
rockets; and, at the same time, the left brigade, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, was to advance and carry the
nearest of the two eastern forts (which was also the rearmost
in relation to the town); while the first brigade, under Major-General
Burrell, having carried a hill in their front, upon
which a body of Chinese were posted, and which flanked the
advance of the left brigade, was to push on and carry the
principal eastern fort, cutting off the communication between
the two, at the same moment when the 49th made their
attack upon the nearest fort.</p>

<p>As the two brigades advanced together, there was some
little rivalry (the strictest discipline being preserved) between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the 49th and 18th regiments, as to which should have the
honour of commencing the attack upon the two forts. The 49th,
having the advantage of a shorter and perhaps rather better
road, got the lead, which they maintained, so that the left
brigade carried BOTH the eastern forts before the 18th came
up, and with little loss.</p>

<p>The two western forts were at the same time gallantly
carried by the brigade of seamen, who were exposed to a
heavy fire of ginjals, wall-pieces, and matchlocks, from the
city walls, by which they suffered some loss.</p>

<p>Thus, in the space of little more than half an hour from
the time the advance was sounded, the heights which overlooked
the city were in our possession, and the British flag
waved in triumph upon all the forts which commanded the
city. The Chinese seemed little inclined to come to close
quarters as our troops advanced, and they were soon driven
out of the forts, making the best of their way down the hills
in confusion.</p>

<p>While our troops were thus engaged upon the heights, the
Chinese threatened an attack upon the landing-place at
Tsingpoo. Their object might have been either to endeavour
to cut off the retreat of our troops from the heights, or else to
get possession of the stores, &amp;c., which had been left behind.
A considerable body of the Chinese sallied out of the western
gate of the city, from which a narrow, irregular causeway, led
down to the landing-place at Tsingpoo.</p>

<p>This movement being immediately observed from the
heights, orders were sent down by Sir Le Fleming Senhouse,
at the suggestion of Sir Hugh Gough, for some of the officers
of the vessels at anchor there to land with their men, and
assist in the defence of the place. These orders were
delivered to Captain Hall by an officer of the Blenheim, sent
on purpose. Preparations had already been made on board
with this object, and Captain Hall lost no time in landing
with half his crew, the other half remaining at quarters on
board, under Lieutenant Pedder. There were twenty-eight
men and two officers (besides Captain Hall) from the Nemesis;
about fourteen men and two officers from the Sulphur; and
eighteen men and two officers from the Blonde; altogether
sixty men and seven officers.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>Having landed and formed, they immediately joined the
small body of troops which had been stationed at the joss-house
to protect the guns, stores, &amp;c., which had been left
behind. They were commanded by Lieutenant Grant, of the
49th, and consisted of thirty men of that regiment, thirty of
the 18th, under Lieutenant Cockburn, and fourteen of the
37th M.N.I., under Ensign Anquitelle. Lieutenant Grant
had got his men under arms the moment the alarm was given,
and, perceiving a body of about two hundred and fifty Chinese
skirmishers advancing in extended order, he moved out to
meet them; when within about fifty yards, he poured in a
smart fire, by which many of them were killed, and drove
them back upon their main body, who were drawn up in close
column, about four hundred strong, (regular troops,) behind
a bridge some distance off, upon which they had planted three
field-pieces. The blue jackets having joined, Captain Hall
instantly led the way, at the head of his own men, <i>directly
down the causeway</i>, towards the bridge; and, under cover of
an excellent fire from the Nemesis and Starling, the whole
column attacked the Chinese in front, and were received with
an ill-directed fire of grape and curious rocket arrows, by
which two men were slightly hit.</p>

<p>The Chinese were driven from their guns, and endeavoured
to rally behind some houses in their rear, but they soon made a
hasty retreat towards the town, closely pursued, for some
distance, by our men. But it was not thought prudent to
follow them within range of the ginjals upon the city walls, as
no good purpose could be effected by it, and some loss might
have been suffered. About thirty of the enemy were supposed
to have been killed and wounded. The three field-pieces
were spiked: and the houses near the bridge, in which a
quantity of military stores were found, were set on fire.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that this little spirited affair, although
officially reported to Sir Le Fleming Senhouse, was never
specially mentioned in any of the public despatches&mdash;an
omission which at that time created some surprise.</p>

<p>To return to our movements upon the heights. During
the greater part of the day, a spirited fire was kept up from
the city walls by guns, ginjals, and matchlocks; which made
it necessary to keep the men under cover as much as possible.</p>

<p>In the rear, and a little to the eastward of the forts occupied
by the 18th and 49th, was a high hill which, in fact, was the
key to the whole position, but it was not fortified. There
was, however, a large joss-house upon the top of it, which
was occupied by a detachment of the 49th regiment. Upon
the low ground to the eastward of this hill, and between it
and a large entrenched camp, situated upon rising ground
close to the suburbs, was a village occupied by Chinese troops.
Frequent communications were passing between it and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
entrenched camp, in which there appeared to be not less than
three or four thousand men. The enemy were soon dislodged
from the village by the 49th, and dispositions were made by
Sir Hugh Gough to carry the entrenched camp by assault.
Several high officers had been observed to pass out of the
city on their way to this camp, and it was evident that some
fresh attack was projected. The 18th were therefore ordered
down from the heights to reinforce the detachment of the
49th, together with a few marines, and Major-General Burrell
was directed to carry the encampment, the only approach to
which was along a narrow causeway. A heavy fire was
opened upon them from guns and ginjals upon the north-eastern
face of the city walls, to which the men were unavoidably
exposed as they advanced. The Chinese seemed to have
got the precise range of the causeway, and some loss was
suffered in consequence. But the enemy were soon driven
gallantly out of the camp, and fled in disorder across the
country. The buildings were then destroyed, together with
several magazines, and the force then returned to the heights.</p>

<p>The day was now far advanced, and the men were much
fatigued with the oppressive heat. The steep and broken
nature of the approach to the heights had made it impossible
to get up the heavy guns and ammunition until the following
day. The assault of the city was therefore deferred; but Sir
Hugh Gough, having made a careful reconnoissance of the
walls and gates, determined to carry them on the following
day, while the panic of the Chinese was still at its height.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th, all was apparently quiet within
the city, except that numbers of people were issuing out
of the gates, which were removed from the scene of action,
hastening to carry away with them all the valuable property
which could be easily transported. Our troops were early
under arms, but no further operations against the city could
be undertaken until the ammunition and the heavy guns could
be brought up.</p>

<p>The weather in the morning did not look auspicious, and
before the day was half over, rain began to fall in torrents.
Few Chinese appeared upon the walls of the city; and at
length, soon after ten o'clock, a flag of truce was displayed
from the walls. It is remarkable how perfectly well the value
of the white flag was remembered (as before noticed by Capt.
Elliot) whenever the Chinese wished to negotiate, or to
induce us to suspend our operations; although they thought
proper to slight it whenever it suited their purpose. Shortly
afterwards the general deputed Mr. Thom, who was attached
to him as interpreter, to advance and ascertain what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Chinese desired. A mandarin, distinguished by a red button,
now stated that they wished to propose terms of peace,
with a view to spare the city, and that in the meantime there
should be a suspension of hostilities. It was replied, that
the general could treat with no other officer than the Chinese
commander-in-chief, his equal in rank; that the British forces
had come before Canton much against the wishes of the English
nation, but were compelled to do so owing to the insults
offered to the British subjects, and the bad faith of the Chinese
high officers; that they might, therefore, address their requests
to Capt. Elliot, who was with the advanced squadron
in the river before the city; and that two or three hours
would be allowed for them to communicate with that officer,
and also to arrange an interview between the English and
the Tartar general; but that if within that period no satisfactory
communication should be received, the white flag
would be struck.</p>

<p>These overtures, on the part of the Chinese, led to no immediate
result. Sir Hugh Gough waited more than four
hours before the white flag was struck, and even then the
Chinese did not lower theirs.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day, and in the course of the
night, by the unwearied exertions of the Royal and Madras
Artillery, assisted by the Sappers and Miners, all the guns
and ammunition were got up, except one 12-pounder howitzer,
the carriage of which had been disabled. During the whole
of this time, the rain fell heavily, which much increased the
necessary labour, and added to the privations of the men, who
either bivouacked or were partially sheltered, as best they
could.</p>

<p>The truce, if it could be so called, was of some use to us,
as it gave time for the completion of all the preparations for
the assault, which was to have taken place at eight o'clock on
the following morning. Our batteries were to have opened
at seven o'clock, and it was expected that the parapet of the
walls, which was high, would have been reduced by the concentrated
fire of our guns. The walls were not less than
twenty-eight to thirty feet high, and were separated from the
heights, from which they were in some parts less than two
hundred paces distant, by an intervening glen.</p>

<p>The broken nature of the ground was peculiarly favourable
for the several attacks which were designed; and as soon as
a lodgment had been made upon the walls, the different
columns of attack were to unite, and make a rush at the fortified
hill, which, as before described, was situated within the
walls, and commanded the interior of the city. The attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was to have been made in four columns, of which the right,
consisting of the royal marines, under Capt. Ellis, was to blow
open the north gate with powder bags; but if that attempt
failed, they were to escalade a circular work thrown up as a
defence to that gate. The second column, composed of the
blue jackets, under Capt. Bourchier, were to escalade the wall
a little beyond the circular work, where its height was not so
great, under cover of musketry. At the same time, the 18th
Royal Irish, under Lieut.-Colonel Adams, were to escalade
the wall close to the seven-storied pagoda, under cover of our
batteries on the heights above. The assault was also to be
covered by the Bengal volunteers, and part of the Madras
87th N.I. Further to the left, the 49th, under Lieut.-Col.
Morris, were directed to carry a sort of bastion in front, and
within range of the largest and nearest of the forts upon the
heights, of which we had got possession the day before. Sir
Hugh Gough's principal object would then have been to
occupy the fortified hill within the walls, upon which a heavy
fire of shells and rockets was to have been kept up during the
assault of the walls.</p>

<p>Every arrangement was thus made which could ensure the
certain and speedy capture of the city, with little loss on our
side. What then must have been the chagrin and disappointment
of the general and all his officers, when, soon after six
o'clock, just as the final orders were given, and the batteries
were about to open, a letter from Capt. Elliot was put into
the general's hands, which announced to him that a truce had
been agreed to, and that further operations must therefore be
suspended. It barely arrived in time to stop the assault of
the city, which was on the point of being commenced. Under
these circumstances, as Sir Hugh Gough observed, "whatever
might be my sentiments or feelings, it was my duty to acquiesce,
and therefore the attack was countermanded, and the
feelings of the Chinese were spared." To this he added that
he had no means of judging of the policy of the measure.</p>

<p>If any further doubt upon the subject remained, it was
finally set at rest by the arrival of Capt. Elliot in person at
the camp, about noon. From that moment all idea of further
hostile operations against the city was abandoned.</p>

<p>Shortly before Capt. Elliot's arrival, Sir Hugh Gough had held
a short conference, accompanied by Sir Le Fleming Senhouse,
with the Tartar General in person, outside the walls, in a
tent pitched for the purpose. The result was of little importance,
as it was already known that terms had been negotiated
by Capt. Elliot.</p>

<p>It could not be doubted that both Sir Hugh Gough and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Sir Le Fleming Senhouse were exceedingly averse to granting
any terms to the Chinese until our troops should have got
possession of the city, and established themselves upon the
fortified hill within the walls, which would have secured our
troops against any possible surprise or treachery, and would
have exercised a salutary moral effect upon the government,
without causing any wanton damage to the town or annoyance
to the people. In fact, it could not have failed to humble
the pride of the Chinese, when they knew that a large garrison
of foreign soldiers had made themselves masters of one of the
principal cities in the empire, supposed to contain nearly a
million of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Various stories were current concerning the mode in which
the ransom of the city was first proposed. One of the most
credited accounts was that the Hong merchants were ordered
by the authorities to go and make terms for the ransom of
the town, in some way or other, under pain of severe displeasure
or punishment. It was said that they were authorized
to go as far as <i>ten</i> millions of dollars, if a less sum
would not suffice; but on no account to return without effecting
the object. They must have known that they would
themselves have to pay the greater part of the amount, and
naturally wished to make the best bargain they could.</p>

<p>It is said that in the first instance they pulled along side
one of our men-of-war, and offered three millions for the ransom
of the city. As they evidently appeared to be in a hurry
to make a bargain of some sort or other, they were told that
a much larger sum would be required. Four millions were
then proposed, and then five millions; and at length, in great
trepidation, and with many protestations of poverty, they
raised the offer to six millions. In the first instance they
were scarcely thought to be in earnest, but as the thing now
really looked serious, they were directed to go and confer
with Capt. Elliot. It was not difficult to persuade him to
grant a truce until twelve o'clock the following day, the 27th;
and, in the intervening time, terms were definitively agreed
upon.</p>

<p>The twenty-four hours' truce, in the first instance, was quite
unknown to Sir Hugh Gough, to whom an officer of the navy
had been sent in the afternoon to convey the information;
but having missed his way, and wandered all night, he only
reached the head quarters, as before stated, within half an
hour of the time the batteries were to open. The fact of the
truce having been granted was now sufficient to account for
the Chinese having continued to display the white flag from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the walls the preceding day, after it had been lowered by Sir
Hugh Gough upon the heights.</p>

<p>As it had been stipulated that the Tartar troops should
leave the city and retire to a distance of sixty miles from it, a
conference was held on the 28th between Sir Hugh Gough
and the prefect of the city, in order to make arrangements for
the evacuation of Canton. It was now ascertained that the
force amounted to no less than forty-five thousand men from
distant provinces, besides those troops which belonged to the
province itself.</p>

<p>The Tartar soldiers were allowed to march out with their
arms and baggage, but without displaying their banners, and
without music.</p>

<p>So far then the authorities appeared to have perfect control
over the people of the city, and over the troops belonging to
other provinces which formed the garrison. But beyond the
city it was not so easy for them to exercise the same degree
of authority, particularly as regarded the armed peasants.
For some time the peasantry of the province, particularly in
the neighbourhood of the city, had been encouraged to form
themselves into societies, or patriotic bands, as they were
called, for mutual defence against the foreigners. They constituted
a sort of rude military; but having inexperienced
leaders and no discipline, they were calculated, if once their
passions were roused, to become much more troublesome to
the province itself than they were formidable to the enemy.
They were imperfectly armed, every man according to his own
taste, with spears, swords, a few matchlocks, and shields.
With perfect ignorance of military affairs, and without any
knowledge of the resources of the enemy they were to encounter,
they believed that, by mere force of numbers, and a
show of courage at a distance, they could effect that which
even their regular Tartars had been totally unable to accomplish.
Yet they were held up to the nation at large by the
government as models of patriotism and self-devotion; and
so impressed were they with the high value of their proffered
services, that they really believed the high officers had betrayed
their trust in acceding to Captain Elliot's terms for the
ransom of the city; and that the anxiety of the inhabitants to
save their own property had induced them to make unreasonable
concessions, at the very moment when <i>they</i> (the patriots)
were advancing to exterminate their enemies by falling upon
their rear.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that, two days after the
city had been ransomed&mdash;namely, on the 29th, a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
body of these men began to collect upon the heights, about
three or four miles in the rear of our positions. Their numbers
continued to increase throughout the day, and Sir Hugh
Gough, being fully prepared to expect some act of treachery
or bad faith under cover of a flag of truce, directed Major-General
Burrell to take charge of our positions, and to hold
every man in readiness to repel any attack from the city, while
he himself advanced in person to meet and disperse the enemy,
who now shewed themselves.</p>

<p>The 26th regiment, under Major Pratt, which had occupied
the factories until the 27th, had been brought up to Tsingpoo
by the Nemesis on that day, and had joined Sir Hugh Gough
upon the heights. The force which the general now took
with him comprised that regiment, the 49th, except one
company left at the joss-house on the heights, the 37th, M.N.I.,
and the company of Bengal Volunteers, supported by the Royal
Marines. These two latter were to be held in reserve, so as to
be in readiness to return towards the heights, and act upon
the flank, should any attack be made from the town during
the absence of so large a portion of our force.</p>

<p>The Chinese had descended from the heights in the rear
upon which they had first appeared, and had taken up rather
a strong position behind an embankment along the bed of a
stream; they appeared to number about four thousand men.
The 26th regiment, which had not yet been engaged, supported
by the 37th M.N.I., were ordered to advance and
drive them from this position, which they effected without
any loss. Like most irregular troops, the Chinese patriots
could not act together in a body, but took to flight, throwing
away their spears as soon as a well directed fire was opened
upon them. They attempted to rally for a moment at a sort
of military post in their rear, but they did not make a stand.
The buildings were immediately destroyed, together with a
magazine, which was unexpectedly found in the adjoining
village. The Chinese retreated to the heights upon which
they had first appeared.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Gough, having then directed the 49th and Bengal
Volunteers to fall back upon our original position upon
the heights, remained to watch in person the movements
of the Chinese, with the 26th and the 37th M.N.I., amounting
together to between five hundred and six hundred men.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun this day was excessive; it was so sultry
that both officers and men suffered great exhaustion, and
Major Beecher, the deputy quartermaster-general, whose
exertions had been unremitting throughout the previous days,
fell down and almost immediately expired; several other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
officers also fell sick. Within two or three hours after the first
repulse of the Chinese, they again collected upon the heights
in greater numbers than before, fresh bodies of them having
now come up with banners, &amp;c., amounting to from seven
thousand to eight thousand men.</p>

<p>Captain Knowles of the artillery, who had been ordered to
bring up some rockets, now threw them with great precision
among the Chinese, but without being able to disperse them;
indeed, they appeared determined to shew a bold front; and
the general, therefore, directed Major Pratt, with the 26th, to
attack a large body of them who had descended from the
heights to some rice-fields on his left. Captain Duff, with
the 37th M.N.I., supported by the Bengal Volunteers, was also
directed to advance and disperse a large body in his front,
who had attempted to reoccupy the military post which had
been already burnt; they were then to push forward towards
the hills, and clear them of the enemy.</p>

<p>These man&oelig;uvres were executed with complete success,
the Chinese being dispersed at all points. The 37th M.N.I.,
however, pushed on rather further than had been intended,
and got separated from the Bengal Volunteers. Captain Duff
had, however, detached a company to open his communication
with the 26th, who were at some distance on his left. But
the day was now far advanced, and the thunder-storm, the
approach of which had been surely indicated by the extreme
sultriness and oppressive heat of the morning, now burst
upon them with inconceivable fury. The rain also descended
in such torrents that the firelocks got wet and scarcely
a single musket would go off. The 26th were, in consequence,
frequently compelled to charge with the bayonet, for the
Chinese, who hovered about them, seeing that they could not
use their firelocks, came boldly up to attack them with their
long spears, which are formidable from their length. After
several repulses, the Chinese at length withdrew, and our
troops were directed to return to their positions.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion, and in the midst of this terrific
storm, in the dusk of evening, that the gallant conduct and
steadiness of the company of the 37th M.N.I., which, as
before stated, had been detached to open a communication
with the 26th, on their left, saved them from total destruction,
and won for them the praise of all military men. The story
has been so often told, and with so little variation in its
details, that it is scarcely necessary to repeat it; a few words
will do justice to their gallantry. The detached company
having missed the road during the storm, did not succeed in
joining the 26th, who, in the meantime, had, in fact, retired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Their muskets were found completely useless, owing to the
wet, which emboldened the Chinese to attack their rear with
their long spears, as they had done the 26th. They were soon
surrounded; and one or two of the men were pulled over with
a long crooked spear, something in the shape of a small
reaping-hook, fixed upon a long pole. The musket of one of
the men who had fallen was picked up by the Chinese, the
powder being so damp in the pan that it would not go off with
the flint and steel. The Chinese soldier, however, deliberately
placed the musket to his shoulder, and, taking steady aim at
one of the officers, Mr. Berkeley, applied his match to the damp
powder, which ignited, and the musket went off, and unfortunately
wounded Mr. Berkeley in the arm.</p>

<p>The gallant little company of Sepoys were now moved to
some rising ground, where they could better defend themselves.
For a moment, the rain ceased; and then with the utmost
difficulty they were enabled to get a few muskets off, with unerring
effect upon the dense mass of Chinese who surrounded
them. But fortune was determined to prolong their trial still.
The rain again descended in torrents, just as they had begun
their retreat; and the Chinese, taking fresh courage, resumed
their attacks. Nothing now remained but to form a square,
and stand true to each other, until the morning dawned, and
enabled them to fight their way through the enemy.</p>

<p>The absence of this company, when all the rest of the force
was concentrated, caused great anxiety concerning their fate.
It was rightly attributed to the severity of the storm, but it was
feared that they might possibly have been cut off by the Chinese.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, Sir Hugh Gough ordered up two
companies of marines, who were comparatively fresh, and
armed with percussion muskets, to return with Captain Duff
in search of the missing company. As they advanced they
fired an occasional shot, as a signal to their comrades of their
approach, and to animate their spirits. At length, an occasional
shot was heard ahead of them, and they soon afterwards
came up with the missing company, drawn up in a square,
surrounded by thousands of Chinese. A couple of volleys sent
into the midst of the confused crowd, by the unerring percussion-muskets<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
of the marines, accompanied by a loud
"hurra," dispersed them with great loss, and they fled in
confusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<p>The generals own words will best do justice to this little
incident:&mdash;"The Sepoys," says he, "in this critical situation,
nobly upheld the high character of the native army, by unshrinking
discipline, and cheerful obedience, and I feel that
the expression of my best thanks is due to Lieutenants Hadfield
and Devereux, and Ensign Berkeley, who zealously supported
them during this trying scene."</p>

<p>They did not, however, escape without some loss, as one private
was killed, and one officer and fourteen men were severely
wounded.</p>

<p>This open hostility of the Chinese, during the operation of
a truce, could not be permitted to continue; and, moreover, it
was evident that no good purpose could be attained by merely
dispersing these irregular bodies of the Chinese. Accordingly,
on the following morning, the 31st, the general sent to inform
the Kwang-chow-foo, or prefect, that if these hostile demonstrations
were continued, he should be under the necessity of
at once hauling down the flag of truce, and of recommencing
hostilities against the city. In the course of the day, before
any further arrangements had been made with the prefect, who
promised to come and meet the general and Captain Elliot
under the walls, the Chinese again collected upon the hills,
displaying their banners, &amp;c., and firing off their guns. Detached
parties were also thrown in advance, as if they had
some design of communicating with the Tartar troops, who, to
the number of 7000, had already marched out of the city, and
were still moving.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the number of Chinese had still further
increased, upon the same hills upon which they had appeared
the day before. At length, the prefect arrived, and assured the
general that the movements of these peasants were quite without
the knowledge or sanction of the authorities, and that he
would immediately send off an officer of rank to order them to
disperse to their homes. It was agreed that one of our own
officers should also accompany him, to endeavour to effect this
object by their joint efforts; and Captain Moore, of the 34th
Bengal N.I., volunteered to undertake this hazardous and
responsible duty. Some treachery might possibly have been
intended, although, as there was reason to believe, without the
sanction of the prefect, who was personally, at that time, completely
in our power. These irregular bodies were at length
induced to disperse, and no further collision took place.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>During all the operations upon the heights, the greater
part of the wounded were brought down and put on board the
Nemesis, where they received every attention from the surgeon
of the vessel, and particularly from Mr. Peter Young, who was
then on board merely as a volunteer. The Nemesis was employed
to convey them daily to their respective ships and
transports. The total number of casualties amounted to
fifteen killed, and one hundred and twelve wounded; among
the latter were no less than fifteen officers.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The Chinese
must have suffered very severely, as almost every shot told
upon their heavy masses.</p>

<p>Upon the heights of Canton forty-nine guns were captured,
besides a great number of ginjals. But if we reckon all the
guns taken and destroyed in the Canton river and its numerous
branches, from Chuenpee to Canton, they will be found to
amount to not less than <i>twelve hundred pieces</i>, besides ginjals,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The resources of the Chinese seemed endless, and the
rapidity with which they erected batteries and field-works was
not a little remarkable. It cannot be said that they yielded
without first making the most strenuous efforts to defend all
the approaches to Canton; and they were rather wanting in
skill, and the knowledge of the best mode of applying their
abundant resources, than in courage or determination to resist.
The Chinese are capable of becoming a formidable
enemy, and we cannot forget that, like the Russians, who were
once so easily conquered, they may soon learn the art of war
from their conquerors, and become formidable from the experience
which their first disasters taught them.</p>

<p>On the 31st of May, nearly 18,000 Tartars had marched
out of Canton, according to the terms agreed on. Five
million dollars had also been paid, and security given for the
other million which was still to be paid. Preparations were
therefore made, at the request of Captain Elliot, for the re-embarkation
of our forces, and their withdrawal from before
Canton. With the assistance of eight hundred Chinese labourers,
who were furnished for the purpose by the prefect,
the guns, ammunition, and stores were brought down to
Tsingpoo on the morning of the 1st of June, under a strong
escort; and the British flag having been lowered in the forts
upon the heights, the whole of our force was re-embarked in
the afternoon, under the superintendence of Captain Bourchier
and Captain Maitland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Hugh Gough particularly noticed the absence of excess
of every kind which distinguished the men during the eight
days they were on shore. Although placed in situations where
temptation was abundant, only two instances of drunkenness
occurred during the whole period.</p>

<p>The treaty, or perhaps rather the truce, which had been
made, by no means implied the conclusion of peace between
the two nations; it had reference solely to the city and river
of Canton, the whole of the forts and defences of which were
to be restored to the Chinese as soon as the ransom had been
paid; it was, however, stipulated that they were not to be
<i>re-armed</i> "until affairs between the two countries should be
finally settled." Accordingly, as soon as our forces, both
military and naval, had been again concentrated at Hong-Kong,
preparations were immediately recommenced for the
resumption of the projected expedition against Amoy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p>In the first week in June, all our ships of war and transports
had left the Canton River, and were again assembled at Hong-Kong.
All the forts from Chuenpee upwards had been restored
to the Chinese, without any other stipulation except
that all those below Whampoa should be suffered to remain
in <i>statu quo</i>.</p>

<p>The emperor seems to have been much displeased with the
latter part of this agreement; and, in reply to the memorial
of Yih-shan upon the subject, his majesty directed that
"<i>secret means</i> of defence should be prepared as soon as the
foreign ships had withdrawn from the river, and that they
were then to build new and strong forts, and repair the old
ones." On our side, however, nothing of this kind was permitted
below Whampoa; so that, until the ratifications of the
treaty of peace had been actually exchanged, the whole of the
defences of the Bogue remained in the same dilapidated state
in which they were left when our squadron quitted the river
in June, 1841.</p>

<p>Sickness had already begun to prevail among our troops
before they had reached Hong-Kong. The eight days' exposure
which they had endured upon the heights of Canton
sowed the seeds of ague and dysentery, which proved far more
formidable energies to us than any troops the Chinese could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
bring against us. After the lapse of a few days, and when the
excitement of active operations on shore, and the cheering
influence of hope and novelty had subsided, the sickness
spread among the men with alarming rapidity, so that, at
length, out of our small force, no less than <i>eleven hundred men</i>
were upon the sick-list at Hong-Kong. Part of this alarming
state of things must be attributed certainly to the pernicious
influence of the atmosphere of Hong-Kong itself at that
season of the year. But every allowance must be made for
the exposure which the men had undergone at Canton, and
for the susceptibility of constitution produced by long confinement
on board ship. The germs of disease were planted
in their bodies before the men returned to the harbour of
Hong-Kong; and, therefore, an undue stress was laid at the
time upon the unhealthiness of Hong-Kong itself. It is
worth while here to mention, that the three imperial commissioners
laid particular stress upon the known unhealthiness
of the neighbourhood of Canton at that season, as a ground
for the impossibility of keeping any large body of troops long
together; and it happened, remarkably enough, that two of
the high officers died as nearly as possible at the same time&mdash;one
on the part of the Chinese, and one on our side. Lung-Wan,
one of the imperial commissioners, died of fever at
Canton about the middle of June; and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse,
the senior naval officer, also died of fever at Hong-Kong
on the 13th of that month.</p>

<p>Sir Le Fleming Senhouse had partaken of all the privations
of the troops on shore, and exposed himself on every occasion
in which his zeal and example could serve the cause. He
was, moreover, undoubtedly chagrined at the unlooked-for
termination of his labours by a truce, the provisions of which,
right or wrong, scarcely accorded with his own views of the
exigencies of the moment. All these causes combined, acting
upon a not over-strong constitution, sufficed to hurry him by
sickness to his grave. On the 17th, his remains were
removed to Macao, according to a wish which he had expressed
before his death, as if he retained a lurking doubt
whether Hong-Kong would not some day or other be restored
to the Chinese. The Nemesis was employed upon this melancholy
occasion, to carry over his remains. At Macao, the
body of the gallant veteran was buried, with all the honours
due to his rank, in the English burial-ground.</p>

<p>The loss of Sir Le Fleming Senhouse and other officers,
as well as a good many men, and the prevailing sickness on
board all the vessels of war and transports, at length threw a
gloom over the whole expedition, which was hardly to be relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
until the expected movement upon Amoy should take
place: this was accordingly looked forward to with great
anxiety.</p>

<p>The island of Hong-Kong, which was originally ceded to
us by the terms of our treaty with Keshen, but, in consequence
of the disallowance of that treaty by the emperor, was
afterwards only held by us by right of occupancy during the
progress of hostilities, was at length confirmed as a possession
of the crown of Great Britain by the ratification of the treaty
of Nankin. It was proclaimed as a part of the British empire,
and, together with its dependencies, erected into a separate
colony, on the 26th of June, 1843, under the designation
of the "Colony of Hong-Kong."</p>

<p>It is difficult to ascertain what are the actual dependencies
of Hong-Kong. They, probably, include all the small islands
immediately adjacent to it, particularly on its southern side;
but whether Lamma Island is comprised in them or not, we
have little means of judging. In the proclamation, dated at
its capital town, Victoria, and published by the authority of
Sir Henry Pottinger, the colony is said to be situated between
twenty-two degrees, nine minutes, and twenty-two degrees,
twenty-one minutes, north latitude, which would give
it an extent of twelve miles from north to south; so that
Lamma Island, as well as the smaller adjacent islands, would
appear to be included in the dependencies. The extent of the
colony from east to west is not distinctly laid down, as only
one meridian of longitude is given-namely, 114° 18' east
longitude from Greenwich.</p>

<p>The position assigned to the island of Hong-Kong in the
maps is, probably, incorrect, as it does not coincide with that
laid down by Sir Henry Pottinger in the proclamation. The
greatest length of the island itself is from east to west&mdash;namely,
eight miles; but the breadth is extremely irregular, varying
from six miles to about two miles only.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The present capital, Victoria, extends for a considerable
distance along its northern shore, and, from the nature of the
ground, has of necessity been, built in a very extended,
straggling manner. The distance across to the mainland of
China, if it can be so called, (for part of the opposite coast is
probably an island,) varies considerably. The breadth of the
Lyemoon Passage to the eastward is little more than a quarter
of a mile, but from the town to the nearest point opposite to
it is about a mile and a quarter, while the greatest breadth is
upwards of four miles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>The roads of Hong-Kong and the Bay of Victoria form an
excellent anchorage, having deep water very near the shore,
and only one small shoal having sixteen feet water upon it.
There are, however, two disadvantages under which it
labours: it is exposed to the full fury of the typhoons whenever
they occur; and the high mountains of Hong-Kong
intercept the genial breezes of the south-west monsoon during
the hot season, when a movement in the atmosphere is most
necessary, not only to moderate the sultry summer heat of a
tropical climate, but to dissipate the unhealthy vapours which
are generated after the heavy rains which occur, particularly
during the night, at that season.</p>

<p>In other respects, the lake-like appearance of the harbour
is beautiful; it forms a sort of basin, lying between the mountains
of Hong-Kong and the mountains of the mainland
opposite. For this reason, however, the rains which fall are
sometimes excessively heavy: the dark, threatening clouds
seem banded across from one side to the other, pouring down
their waters in torrents upon the basin between them. The
mountain sides of Hong-Kong, steep though they are, occasionally
appear almost covered with a sheet of moving water,
so torrent-like do the streams pour down their declivities. To
this succeeds the burning, tropical sun of July, with a sort of
death-like stillness in the atmosphere, which, little influenced
as it is on that side of the island by the south-west monsoon,
cannot fail, if it last long without any change, to produce fever
and sickness.</p>

<p>Almost all tropical countries are occasionally subject to these
visitations; but, as a proof that Hong-Kong is not always exposed
to them, I may be permitted to mention that a gentleman
who was once at anchor there, in company with a fleet of
full fifty sail of merchant ships during a period of nine months,
including the whole summer season, declared that he observed
<i>no prevailing fever or sickness of any kind</i>.</p>

<p>The extremely barren appearance of nearly all the islands
at the mouth of the Canton River, the deep and rugged
furrows which seem to plough up their mountain sides, the
exposed, rocky surface of their summits, and the absence of
soil, except in sheltered spots or hollows, seem at once to
point out that they are situated within the influence of hurricanes
and tropical rains. In this respect, the contrast between
this part of China and the Chusan Islands to the northward,
is very remarkable. The latter look as rich and inviting, both
near and at a distance, as the former appear inhospitable and
barren. In the one case, there is an industrious and thriving
population, who contrive to cultivate the surface of the mountains,
frequently to their very summits, with the greatest care
and nicety; in the other case, there is a hardy and adventurous
population of fishermen, smugglers, and pirates; the unwilling
soil is only cultivated in scattered patches, and the villages
are few, and comparatively of mean appearance.</p>

<p>The southern side of the island of Hong-Kong was visited
by Capt. Hall, in the squadron which conveyed Lord Amherst's
embassy to China in 1816; and it is, therefore, worth while
to repeat here the observations of Dr. Clarke Abel Smith upon
that occasion. The bay in which the vessels anchored was
near the village of Shekpywan, and was then called Hong-Kong
Sound. It was described as "being formed by several
small islands, by which it is land-locked on every side, and of
which Hong-Kong is the principal." "As seen from the deck,"
says Dr. Smith, "this island was chiefly remarkable for its
high, conical mountains rising in the centre, and for a beautiful
cascade, which rolled over a fine blue rock into the sea."</p>

<p>This was in the beginning of July. The rocks on that side
of the island were found approaching to basalt in compactness
of structure. In ascending the principal mountain which was
near, he followed the course of a delightful stream, which rises
near its summit; and was much struck with the extreme barrenness
of the surface of the mountain, and, indeed, of every
part of the island which he was able to visit. "Yet, at a distance,"
says he, "it appears <i>fertile</i>, from the <i>abundance of fern</i>,
which I believe to be the polypodium trichotomum, [of
Kæmpfer,] which supplies <i>the place of other plants</i>."</p>

<p>By the side of the stream, however, he found several interesting
plants. Among them the Beckia chinensis; myrtus
tomentosus in abundance, and in full flower; melastoma quinquenervia;
and several orchideous plants, of which he could
not determine the varieties. There were a great number of
ferns, but not a single moss of any description. He adds that
he was unable to reach the summit of the mountain, in consequence
of the excessive heat, which, at eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, raised the
thermometer to 83° in the shade, while the sun's rays, to which
he was necessarily exposed, darted through an unclouded
atmosphere with an almost intolerable effect, and raised the
mercury to 120°.</p>

<p>On his way down from the mountain, he followed a path
which led over a small hill, or rather mound, differing in
structure from the rocks in its neighbourhood, being composed
of very friable stone, of reddish white colour, much resembling
disintegrated felspar. He describes the scenery of the island
as composed of barren rocks, deep ravines, and mountain torrents,
with few characters of a picturesque kind. The only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
inhabitants he saw were some poor weather-beaten fishermen
spreading their nets, and drying the produce of their toils, on
the rocks which supported their miserable huts. Its cultivation
corresponded with the apparent state and number of its
population. Patches of rice, small plantations of yams, and
a little buck-wheat, were all their visible means of vegetable
support.</p>

<p>As regards the anchorage itself, at what he calls Hong-Kong
Sound, naval men described it as affording admirable shelter
for ships of any burden.</p>

<p>Such, then, is all the information acquired at that time concerning
a portion of the southern side of Hong-Kong. Little
was it then thought, that this very island would, in a few
years, become a part of the British empire.</p>

<p>The description given above of the general aspect of Hong-Kong,
may be considered as tolerably correct, but, by the
increase of its population since that period, and more particularly,
after it became a place of resort for our ships, even
before the close of the war, the general appearance of the
island gradually improved, and the population became augmented.
At the time we took possession of the island, there
was little to tempt us to make a settlement there, except the
excellent anchorage on its northern side, having a passage in
and out at either end, its proximity to the mouth of the Canton
river, and the difficulty of finding any more suitable place for
our purpose.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of Hong-Kong there are capital stone-quarries,
which are worked with skill and facility by Chinese
labourers, so that building is much facilitated; water is also
abundant and generally good. A long range of mountains
stretches from one end of the island to the other, of which,
the highest point, called Victoria Peak, is about two thousand
feet above the level of the sea; and, at the foot of the very
mountain, part of the town of Victoria (and it would seem
also its most unhealthy part,) is built. Now, as this range of
rugged mountains extends from east to west, the harbour, and
consequently the principal part of the town and places of
business lying upon its northern side, it is self-evident that
the influence of the south-west monsoon, which prevails during
the summer months, and is then most required to dissipate
the vapours generated out of the earth by a tropical sun, can
scarcely ever be felt on the northern side of the mountains.
It has even been remarked, that <i>in all parts of</i> China, places
so situated as to be sheltered from the influence of the south
winds during the summer season, are sure to be unhealthy.</p>

<p>The mere temperature of a place, as shewn by the thermometer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
is neither an index to its unhealthiness or otherwise,
nor to the actual sensations produced by it upon the human
body. For instance, at Singapore, which is situated only
about seventy miles from the equator, the heat is not felt to be
excessive, nor is sickness prevalent during any season of the
year. Yet rain falls constantly during the night, the grass
looks beautifully green even in the hottest season, and when
pineapples are to be seen growing wild in the hedges, and
coming to perfection. But Singapore is entirely open to the
southward, and its atmosphere is agitated and its vapours
dissipated, by the refreshing sea-breezes which constantly pass
over it.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of the month of July last, (1843,)
at Hong-Kong, was 88°, the lowest was 84°, and the highest
92°. Hence it appears, that the difference of temperature
between day and night, is much less than might be expected;
in fact, the <i>lowest</i> temperature was only four degrees below the
average temperature of the whole month. On one occasion
only, it rose to 92° during the middle of the day, and once
only, fell to 84° during the night.</p>

<p>But, if the town of Victoria is deprived of the advantage
of the south-west breezes during the hot season, it is fully
exposed to the influence of the north-east monsoon during
the winter months. The sudden change which takes place
sometimes in a few hours, in the months of October and
November, is severely felt. In the beginning of December, I
have felt the cold breezes from the northward far more piercing
than the hardest frost in the still atmosphere of northern
regions, because the change is sudden. Hence, the practice
among the Chinese, of putting on a succession of warm coats,
or wadded pelisses, or taking them off one by one, according
as the temperature changes, is the only safe course for Europeans
to adopt. In fact, all those who visit Hong-Kong, or
take up a lengthened residence there, must be provided with
clothing adapted to the extremes of temperature, and be
cautious not to defer the changes of costume too long; they
should rather err on the side of too much than too little
clothing.</p>

<p>Now I am upon the subject of the unhealthiness of Hong-Kong
generally, (to which subject, however, I shall again
revert,) I cannot omit to mention that the sickness has by no
means been limited to those who resided on shore, but has to
a very great extent afflicted those also who remained on board
ship. Nor did it diminish so rapidly as had been expected,
(during the past year, 1843,) as the season advanced and the
temperature diminished. On the contrary, after being in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
great measure arrested at the commencement of November, it
seemed to acquire fresh virulence towards the latter end of
that month. A private letter, dated November 3rd, says,
"The men-of-war are reducing their sick lists. The Cornwallis
has now only one hundred and four; the other day she had
one hundred and sixty under the doctor's hands." Another
letter, dated the 28th of the same month, says, "The sickness
is again as bad as ever. Each ship loses a man daily. Among
the troops on shore how many are lost! Many gentlemen
who have been sick, and are now recovering, are starting off
for England, for health's sake."</p>

<p>Health committees have, however, been established, and it
is hoped that some good may result from their investigations.
All parts even of the northern side of the island are not
equally unhealthy; and it must be remembered that a place
may be very unhealthy one year, and be comparatively free
from sickness the following year.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It is also remarked that
the occurrence of a typhoon (though in other respects much
to be dreaded) tends materially to improve the healthiness of
an otherwise sickly place, by the violent phenomena, barometrical
and electrical, which it produces, and by which all
nature is affected.</p>

<p>Hitherto the western and eastern extremities of Victoria
Bay seem to have proved most unhealthy to Europeans, the
centre being less so. The left wing of the 55th, quartered at
West Point barracks, lost one hundred men between June and
the middle of August last; and at length the place was abandoned,
and the rest of the men sent on board ship. At the
recommendation of a health committee, the ground in the
neighbourhood was ordered to be levelled and well drained.
This essential measure will doubtless be resorted to in other
situations; indeed, it would be a matter of the highest importance,
if possible, to prohibit the cultivation of rice by the
Chinese upon <i>any part</i> of the island. Wherever rice is grown,
particularly within or verging upon the tropics, there must be
more or less unhealthiness. If compensation were thought
requisite, to reimburse the Chinese proprietors for the loss of
their crops, the amount would be small in comparison with
the advantage gained. But, in reality, where the rice-grounds
(which, after all, are very limited) had been properly drained,
they might be adapted to the cultivation of other productions
equally necessary for a population numbering so many
Europeans, and less likely to be prejudicial to the health of
the community.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>At the eastern extremity of Victoria Bay is a considerable
valley, shut up by mountains on every side, except towards
the sea. It is laid out almost entirely in rice-grounds, and the
waters of a natural stream, descending from the mountains at
the end of the valley, had been diverted from their natural
channel, and conducted by innumerable streamlets to every
part of the valley, for the irrigation of the rice-grounds.
Several houses have been built upon the declivity of the hills
around it, in the expectation that this would be the ultimate
site of a second town, as soon as the very limited space between
the mountains and the harbour, along the front of Victoria
Bay, should be completely occupied, which it bids fair
soon to become. The draining of this valley would essentially
improve the condition of that important portion of the island.</p>

<p>A good road has already been nearly completed across that
valley, and over the mountains to the other side of the island,
leading down to Tytam Bay, and the important village of
Chek-Chu. Beyond this valley to the eastward, on the other
side of Matheson's point, are fine bold rocks, running down to
the water's edge, being also more open to the draught of air
along the Lyemoon passage, this position would probably be
a healthy one.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken so much concerning the northern side
of the island in particular, it may be asked what is the state
of the southern side, as regards its healthiness. Undoubtedly,
the southern side, being open to the south-west monsoon, is
comparatively healthy, but there is no harbour fit for mercantile
purposes on that side, nor was any land appropriated there
for building purposes in the first instance, because the unhealthiness
of Victoria Bay was not fully ascertained, and because,
where a man's treasure or his business is, there will his
heart and his occupation be also. Doubtless, in a very short
time many of the Europeans will reside on the southern side
of the island, and cross over the mountains daily to transact
their business.</p>

<p>The principal Chinese village, which numbered a population
of about two thousand, even when we took possession of the
island, is prettily situated on the southern side, in a sheltered
bay, well open, however, to the south-west wind. It is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Chek-Chu, and, at the suggestion of Major Aldrich, cantonments
have been formed for a detachment of troops there, so
as to separate them from the Chinese population. A detachment
of the 98th regiment, which was quartered there during
the last season, remained almost entirely healthy; and there is
little doubt that in a short time many Europeans will take up
their residence in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to form any tolerable estimate of the
Chinese population on the island. It varies continually, a
great part of the people being migratory. When we first took
the island there were probably about five thousand Chinese
upon it, exclusive of the boat-people, casual labourers from the
opposite coast, and others of a migratory description. They
were distributed into fourteen or fifteen villages or hamlets, of
which the principal, as before stated, was Chek-chu, on the
southern side, situated in a bay partly formed by the long
irregular headland which runs out and takes the name of
Tytam Head. This bay, together with Tytam Bay, will
doubtless soon become a favourite spot for the retired residences
of Europeans.</p>

<p>Since we have held possession of the island, the Chinese
have naturally been attracted to it in great numbers. The
tradesmen, mechanics, servants to English residents, labourers,
boatmen, and market people, are all Chinese. Add to these
also, a small body of Chinese police, and we shall find that
the population must be considerable. In all the warehouses
of the merchants a vast number of porters and attendants are
employed; all the houses are built by Chinese workmen, and
a vast number are also employed by government upon the
public roads and works. The number of migratory, or trading
people, who come down from Canton, Macao, and other
parts, is also large; so that upon the whole the high estimate
of 30,000 which has been given, may not be much overrated.
But this number probably includes the Europeans, the number
of whom, exclusive of the military, cannot be large, perhaps
a very few hundreds.</p>

<p>The reputed unhealthiness of the town of Victoria has deterred
many from coming over from Macao for the present,
who otherwise contemplated establishing themselves on the
island. The uncertainty which has prevailed respecting the
liberty to store opium, has also tended to give a check to the
originally rapid progress of the settlement.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Portuguese, becoming fully sensible
of the deterioration of the value of property at Macao, owing
to the sudden rise of a rival European settlement in their
neighbourhood, began to take into consideration the propriety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of rendering Macao a free port, similar to Hong-Kong, and
probably without any restrictions as to opium. Great efforts
have been made to effect this object, and the Portuguese
governor had gone up to Canton, attended by his suite, with
a view to confer with the authorities, in the hope of procuring
from the government the recognition of greater privileges
than they had hitherto enjoyed. This circumstance, together
with the momentary pause at Hong-Kong, had tended to reassure
the European inhabitants of Macao, and to raise the
value of houses (which had previously fallen) from ten to
fifteen per cent.</p>

<p>If means should be found (of which strong hopes are entertained)
of improving the condition of Hong-Kong, as regards
its healthiness, no attempted rivalry of Macao could affect the
new settlement to any extent. It has neither a harbour for
ships to anchor in sufficiently near the town, nor ground
upon which warehouses could be built, nor can the Portuguese
officers ever possess more than a very restricted, and perhaps
precarious authority.</p>

<p>The wonderful progress of our settlement at Hong-Kong,
in the first instance, affords perhaps one of the most striking
instances that has ever been recorded of the astonishing
energy and enterprise of the British character. Great as
were the early strides made even by some of the Australian
colonies, situated too at the opposite end of the globe, their
progress, compared with that of Hong-Kong, was slow and
difficult. When our forces were assembled in the harbour of
Hong-Kong, on their return from Canton, in June, 1841,
there was not a single regularly built house fit for the habitation
of Europeans upon the island; for the Chinese villages
can hardly be taken into account. When the expedition set
sail for Amoy, about two months afterwards, a few mat-sheds
and temporary huts were all that indicated the future site of
the town of Victoria, or pointed out what was soon to become
the centre of British commerce in that part of the world, and
the seat of British power upon the threshold of the most
populous empire the world ever saw.</p>

<p>The first sale by auction of land, or rather of the annual
quit-rents only, was held in June. On the 7th of that month,
Hong-Kong was declared to be a free port, and on the 22nd,
Mr. A. R. Johnston, the deputy-superintendent of trade, was
appointed acting governor of the island.</p>

<p>The portion of land put up for sale, in the first instance,
consisted of only thirty-four lots, each of which was to have a
sea-frontage of about one hundred feet; but the depth of each
lot, of course, varied considerably, according to the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the ground. The sale of the annual quit-rents only, payable
in advance, produced no less a sum than £3165. 10s. yearly,
at this first sale. Equally high prices also were obtained on
subsequent occasions. Moreover, one of the conditions of
sale was, that each purchaser should be required to incur an
outlay upon each lot, within the <i>first six</i> months, either in
building or otherwise, of not less than one thousand dollars,
or upwards of two hundred and twenty-two pounds sterling,
and a deposit of five hundred dollars was to be paid into the
hands of the treasurer within one week, but was to be repayable
as soon as an equal amount had been expended.</p>

<p>Accordingly, within six months from the time above named,
wonderful improvements had taken place, although much preliminary
work was necessary before any solid building could
be erected. In fact, the first regular house built for Europeans
was not completed until September or October following; and,
as it was constructed entirely by Chinese mechanics, it
assumed very much the form of a Chinese house.</p>

<p>The government now began to form an excellent road,
called the Queens Road, along the front of the harbour, and
to encourage improvements in every possible way. The
elements of a regular establishment were soon formed, and the
nucleus of a powerful European community was soon planted
upon the borders of haughty China. Its progress from this
moment was wonderful, and no stronger argument than this
can be adduced to point out the <i>necessity</i> of such an emporium
as Hong-Kong, and the impossibility of continuing the former
state of things.</p>

<p>Within <i>one year</i> from the completion of the first house, not
only were regular streets and bazaars for the Chinese erected,
but numerous large substantial warehouses were built mostly
of stone, some already finished, and others in progress.
Wharfs and jetties were constructed of the most substantial
kind; the sound of the stone-mason's hammer was heard in
every direction, and a good road was in progress, and an
admirable market was established in English style, under
covered sheds, and well-regulated by the police. The Chinese
willingly resorted to it, and brought abundant supplies of
every description, readily submitting themselves to all the
regulations. Large commissariat stores and other public
buildings, including barracks at either end of the town, were
finished. The road, which was carried along the foot of the
hills, extended already to a distance of nearly four miles, and
a cut was being made through a high sand-hill, in order to
continue it further; and at intervals, along the whole of the
distance, substantial and even elegant buildings were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
erected. The numerous conical hills which distinguish this
part of the island were nearly all levelled at the top, in readiness
to commence building new houses; stone bridges were in
progress, and the road was being rapidly continued over the
hills at the eastern end of Victoria Bay, leading down to
Tytam Bay, and the picturesque village of Chek-chu.</p>

<p>The Chinese inhabitants seemed to fall readily into our
ways and habits; their labourers and mechanics worked well
and willingly for moderate pay, and came over in crowds from
the opposite coast to seek work; tradesmen crowded in to
occupy the little shops in the bazaars; two European hotels
and billiard-rooms were completed; and, in short, every
necessary, and most luxuries, could be obtained with facility at
Hong-Kong, <i>within the first year of its permanent settlement</i>.
Even the Portuguese missionaries came over and built a sort
of convent and a chapel; the Morrison Education Society and
the Missionary Hospital Society commenced their buildings;
more than one missionary society made it their head-quarters,
and the Anglo-Chinese College, at Malacca, was about to be
removed to this more favourable spot. A small Roman-catholic
chapel was nearly finished, and a neat little American
Baptist chapel had been opened for divine service, being the
first Protestant place of public worship ever established in
that part of the world&mdash;of course, with the exception of the old
company's chapel, in the factory at Canton. There was, however,
no church of England service performed at that time
on the island&mdash;a deficiency which happily has since been
remedied.</p>

<p>Foreign merchants had also commenced building, and it
was a curious sight to see the hundreds of Chinese labourers
working upon the construction of <i>our</i> houses and roads, and
flocking from all quarters to furnish <i>us</i> with supplies,
and seeking their living by serving us in every way, at
the very time when we were at war with their government,
and carrying on hostile operations against their countrymen
to the northward. At the same time, also, Chinese tailors
and shoemakers were busy in their little shops making clothes
for us, and Chinese stewards superintended our establishments,
while Chinese servants (in their native costume, tails
and all) were cheerfully waiting upon us at table: and all this
within little more than one year after the <i>first</i> land-sale at
Hong-Kong, and while we were still at war.</p>

<p>There appears to have been some little mistake in the
original site of the town, the principal part of which, or, at
least, the part most inhabited by the Chinese, is situated, in
a great measure, upon the declivity of the highest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
mountains which shut in the harbour. The space for building
is very limited, and, indeed, this is the case along the
whole shore. Gradually people have spread themselves eastward
along the front of the harbour, and, probably, at no very
distant time, a second town will spring up at the eastern end
of the harbour; indeed, the buildings already erected by
Messrs. Jardine and Matheson are so extensive, as to form
almost a town of themselves. But the great distance from
one end of Hong-Kong, or rather of Victoria to the other, is
already a source of great inconvenience, particularly in a hot
country. In a short time, the establishment of an exchange
in some central part will probably be undertaken, and will
go far to remedy the inconvenience.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the space between the foot of the
mountains and the edge of the sea is so very limited. It
would have been a great advantage to have been able to form
a quay or esplanade along the front of the harbour, with
warehouses and dwelling-houses in the rear. But this was
not practicable; and, consequently, the back of the warehouses
in most instances faces the water, which in some
measure detracts from the appearance of the town, as seen
from the harbour. Nevertheless, it is impossible for the
stranger not to be struck with the first view of it as he approaches.
He could scarcely be prepared to see so many
large, handsome buildings occupying a great extent of frontage
in a settlement so recently acquired.</p>

<p>There are few things more striking of the kind than the
view of the Bay of Victoria and the roads of Hong-Kong,
from any one of the hills at its eastern end towards Matheson's
Point. The number of European vessels, Chinese junks,
boats of all kinds, and the long line of handsome buildings
skirting the bay, and lighted up by a brilliant sun piercing
a cloudless atmosphere, present a picturesque and interesting
scene, which is scarcely detracted from even by the barren
mountains in the rear.</p>

<p>As regards the defences of Hong-Kong, it is evident that
our main reliance must always be placed upon our ships of
war. The two small batteries already erected could be of little
service against an enemy. A plan was submitted by Major
Aldrich, the commanding engineer, for forming a large fort
somewhere about the centre of the bay. But this plan did
not meet the concurrence of Sir Henry Pottinger, although he
referred it for the consideration of the government at home.</p>

<p>The question of the tenure of land for the future at Hong-Kong,
or rather the terms upon which it can be obtained from
the government is one of the highest importance. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
understood that it is not the intention of government to permit
any land to be alienated from the crown. Future sales of
land will probably be effected in the same way as the earlier
ones; that is, merely the annual rental of the different lots of
land will be put up to auction. No regulations upon this
subject have yet been issued; and, most likely, the new governor,
Mr. Davis, will have some discretionary power in fixing
the precise terms upon which the <i>right of occupation</i> of land
will be disposed of. The system of annual rentals to government
in a colony circumstanced as Hong-Kong is,&mdash;a free
port, a soil mostly barren, and an island of very limited
extent,&mdash;must appear to every one the most judicious plan to
adopt. A <i>permanent</i> annual fund will thus be created for the
purposes of government, and one which must increase every
year rather than diminish.</p>

<p>Hong-Kong will always possess the immense advantage of
abundant labour at a reasonable rate. Any number of Chinamen
which could possibly be required will always be readily
obtained from the mainland.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention, among the strong characteristics
of English colonization, the establishment of a free
press at Hong-Kong. A newspaper is usually one of the first
undertakings in an English settlement. It has been said, in
respect to colonization, that the first thing the French undertake
is to build a fort, the Spaniards a church, and the English
a factory or a warehouse; but, perhaps, it is more characteristic
still, that one of the first things the English establish is
a press. The Englishman carries with him his birthright of
free discussion; and the power of having a good hearty
grumble in <i>print</i> compensates him for many early inconveniences
of a new settlement. There are four English newspapers
published in China; the Hong-Kong Gazette, the
Eastern Globe, the Hong-Kong Register, and the Canton
Press; of which the last is published at Macao, and the other
three at Hong-Kong. In the first-named, all the government
notices are inserted by authority.</p>

<p>According to the latest accounts, the Morrison Institution
had been opened for some time, and the youths who were
being educated were making good progress. The Seaman's
Hospital for the merchant service, recently opened, was calculated
to afford accommodation to fifty men and officers. This
institution is in a measure a self-supporting one, a certain
sum being paid daily for the maintenance of each person admitted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>It is intended that Hong-Kong shall be governed upon the
same principles by which other crown colonies are regulated&mdash;namely,
that there shall be a legislative and an executive
council, to aid the governor with their advice and assistance.</p>

<p>The importance of Hong-Kong, not only with regard to the
commerce of all nations with China, but more especially with
reference to our relations with the Chinese government, cannot
be estimated too highly. However scrupulous we may be
in the first instance to limit our intercourse, as much as
possible, to the mere commercial questions which may arise,
it is impossible not to foresee that other complications may
result from it, the issue of which it would be presumptuous to
predict. A new era has at length opened upon China, a
sudden and almost incredible change in all her relations with
foreigners; and the ease and apparent readiness with which
she has acceded to all the proposed arrangements respecting
trade, is perhaps not less remarkable than the pertinacious
obstinacy with which she had so long and so haughtily
refused to make any change whatever in the established order
of things.</p>

<p>Providence has at length ordained that a vast empire, which
comprises nearly a third of the human race, shall no longer
remain totally excluded from the great family society of
nations; and we cannot but believe that the period has at
length arrived when that wonderful nation is, by a slow but
steady progress, to be brought under the influence of Christianity.
But, while we are impressed with this feeling, let us
not be too hasty in precipitating a crisis which may convulse
a mighty empire from one end to the other. This, then,
leads us to the momentous question of the ultimate disorganization
or breaking up of the Chinese empire. <i>This is
the great event which we have to dread</i>; for who can contemplate
the fearful results of such a crisis without alarm, and
without a desire to prevent a catastrophe of so vast a nature?</p>

<p>In this point of view, the possession of Hong-Kong, the
state of our relations with the Chinese government, and the
difficult questions which may possibly, at no distant period,
require our most anxious attention, (it must not be forgotten
that the present Emperor of China is already in the decline of
life) involve a degree of responsibility which cannot be too
deeply felt, and can scarcely be approached without misgivings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Every member of the government of Hong-Kong must, therefore,
be keenly alive to the responsibility of his position, and
must watch with profound anxiety every one of the widely
spreading circles into which the acts of our administration
may ultimately extend themselves. We must stand up before
the Chinese government, not only in the relation of a friend,
but <i>of an ally</i>; and, instead of weakening its authority, we
ought rather to support its influence in the eyes of its own
people. Our intercourse with that remarkable nation ought
to be recorded in the pages of history as a blessing, and not,
what it might readily become, without great caution and prudence&mdash;a
curse.</p>

<p>Impressed with the truth of these observations, the first
great and difficult question which awakens our anxiety, is that
of the future relations of the opium-trade, and the course
which is to be pursued with respect to it at Hong-Kong.
Great anxiety has been felt as to the regulations which may
be applied to it, in our own settlement, which is understood
to be in all respects a free port. It would seem, therefore,
that the storage of opium at Hong-Kong could hardly be prohibited;
and yet it is difficult to discover how it would be
possible, in that case, to avoid the dilemma of appearing in
the eyes of the Chinese government to sanction, and even encourage,
a description of trade especially prohibited by the
Emperor. The simplest and indeed the only effectual mode
by which all the difficulties of the question could be surmounted
would be, inducing the Chinese government to
legalize the trade, and to consent to the introduction of the
drug, upon payment of a certain duty.</p>

<p>No stronger arguments could be advanced in favour of this
step than those already employed by Chinese writers themselves,
in the various memorials presented to government
on the subject. Although the opium-trade is not even alluded
to in either of our recent treaties, it is well known that Sir
Henry Pottinger has used his best efforts to induce the
Chinese government to consent to the legalization of the
trade, and to introduce the article into the tariff. It is possible
that this object may be ultimately effected, but at present
we have no reason to believe that any material progress has
been made towards bringing this question to a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the opium-trade has never been more
thriving than during the past year, and bitter complaints have
appeared in the Pekin gazettes, of the introduction of the drug
even into the imperial palace. The emperor appears to be
as hostile to the opium-mania as ever, and yet all his measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
against it are quite as ineffectual as they have ever been. In
fact, the people are determined to enjoy the forbidden luxury
at all hazards, and no means hitherto attempted have deterred
even the public officers of government from conniving at the
clandestine trade, nor is it likely that they will ever be proof
against the temptation of heavy bribes, which the large profits
derived from the traffic enable those concerned in it to offer.</p>

<p>Should the trade in opium become ultimately legalized, it
cannot be doubted that it would greatly tend to the advantage
of Hong-Kong, and would induce many Chinese merchants to
come over and seek it there, who would at the same time be
tempted to make other purchases as well. The drug would
then in some measure be paid for in the produce of the
country, and not, as it is at present, in silver exclusively, and,
in fact, all the commercial relations of the country would at
once be placed upon a much more satisfactory footing.</p>

<p>There is, however, another point out of which difficulties
may arise, besides the one above mentioned&mdash;namely, the
attempts of foreigners to enter China at other places besides
the five ports, or even, at these latter, to push themselves
beyond the limits indicated by the Chinese authorities.
According to our present understanding, certain boundaries
are to be laid down, beyond which no foreigners are to pass.
But there will be many difficulties in the way of preventing
the violation of these regulations. Already something of this
kind has occurred, and the interference of Sir Henry Pottinger
had been called for. A little pamphlet has even been published
at Macao, called a "Narrative of a recent visit to the Chief
City of the department of Changchow, in the Province of
Fokien." In this case the aggressors were not Englishmen,
but Americans, and they forced their way into the country, in
opposition to the wishes and orders of the local authorities,
who pointed out to them that their doing so was contrary to
the provisions of the treaty. It is evident that they passed
themselves off for Englishmen, and were thought to be so by
the authorities.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Pottinger thought it incumbent on him to advise
the viceroy and lieutenant-governor of Canton, that these
individuals were not Englishmen, and to express his hope
that in future the local mandarins would seize and confine all
those who might commit the smallest infraction of the treaty,
(if British subjects) and send them to the nearest English
consular officer, to be dealt with as might be found necessary,
in order to enforce implicit obedience.</p>

<p>The last point to which I think it necessary to allude is the
mutual surrender of criminals, so that English offenders who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
may take refuge in China may be given up to our consular
officers by the Chinese authorities, and Chinese offenders who
may take refuge at Hong-Kong, or on board our ships, may be
given up to the Chinese officers. This stipulation has already
been acted upon at Hong-Kong, where a party of pirates who
were chased ashore by the Chinese government cruisers were
instantly seized by the police, and handed over to the proper
Chinese officers.</p>

<p>In fact, the more we reflect upon the position in which we
now stand in presence of the Chinese government, and in the
actual possession of an island upon its frontiers, the more we
must become impressed with the vast responsibility which
attaches to all our proceedings, and the great necessity which
exists for the utmost caution, prudence, judgment, and firmness
on the part of every public officer employed in our
service in that country.</p>

<p>I have reserved all mention of the terrific storms to which
Hong-Kong is occasionally exposed during the summer season.
Our squadron, after its return from Canton, was exposed to
the full fury of one of these hurricanes, while it lay in the
harbour previously to our advance upon Amoy. The Chinese,
although ignorant of the use of the barometer, acquire from
experience a tolerably accurate knowledge of the indications
which determine the approach of these dreaded typhoons.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Victoria Bay, although completely land-locked,
lies fully exposed to the whole fury of the tempest
from its beginning to its end; there is no shelter whatever on
that side of the island. It is a curious and novel sight to
watch the preparations which the Chinese make for the approaching
storm; the mixture of superstitious observance and
prudent precaution which they adopt, either in the hope of
averting the threatening tempest, or of securing themselves
against its immediate effects. The sultry, oppressive feeling
of the atmosphere, the deep black clouds, and other indications,
warn them to be prepared; and, from the noise and
excitement which soon take place among the Chinese, one
would rather imagine they were celebrating some festival of
rejoicing than deprecating the fury of the gods. Many of
their houses, on these occasions, are decorated with lanterns
stuck upon long poles twenty or thirty feet high, huge grotesque-looking
figures, and various devices. The beating of
gongs, the firing of crackers, and explosion of little bamboo
petards, from one end of the town to the other, and in all the
boats along the shore, create such a din and confusion, that a
stranger cannot help feeling that there must be danger at
hand, of some kind or other, besides that of a storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>It is also a curious sight to watch the hundreds of boats
and junks getting under weigh at the same moment, all eager
to get across to the opposite shore, under shelter of the mainland,
as fast as possible, knowing full well that they would be
certainly stranded if they remained on the Hong-Kong side.
In the high stern of every junk stands a man, who perseveringly
beats a large suspended gong with his utmost strength,
while the rest of the crew appear quite as intent upon firing
off crackers as upon the management of their boat. By this
means they hope to awaken their tutelary god, and to induce
him to listen to their prayers for succour. The greater part
of them take refuge in a bay directly opposite Victoria, from
which it is about four miles distant, under the lee of the
mountains on that side.</p>

<p>Frequently all the threatening appearances which call forth
these preparations pass off without producing a typhoon.
The flashes of lightning are fearfully quick and brilliant; the
peals of thunder are almost deafening; the huge black clouds
hang gloomily over the mountains, or are banded across from
one side to the other, pouring their waters in torrents upon
the basin between them. In this way the storm at length
subsides, and the horrors of a typhoon are averted.</p>

<p>The actual typhoon is of a very different description; in
fact, it differs in no respect from the worst hurricanes which
visit the Mauritius or the West Indies. Hong-Kong was
visited in this way on the 21st and 26th of July, 1841, and a
more severe typhoon than that which took place on the first
of those days is, perhaps, never experienced. The theory of
these circular storms has been well laid down by Colonel Reid
and others; so that in the present day a vessel caught in them
at sea would be much less exposed to danger than formerly,
provided her captain had made himself master of the well-confirmed
theories which have been propounded upon the
subject. The sphere of their operation is very limited, neither
do they occur every year, but seldom oftener than every three
or four years.</p>

<p>At Hong-Kong, various ominous appearances were the
forerunner of the storm on the occasion alluded to. For
some days previously, large black masses of clouds appeared
to settle upon the hills on either side: the atmosphere was
extremely sultry and oppressive; the most vivid lightning
shot incessantly along the dense, threatening clouds, and
looked the more brilliant because the phenomena were always
most remarkable at night, while during the day the threatening
appearances were moderated considerably, and sometimes
almost entirely disappeared. The vibrations of the mercury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in the barometer were constant and rapid; and, although it
occasionally rose, still the improvement was only temporary,
and upon the average it continued to fall. A typhoon was,
therefore, confidently predicted, and the more so because none
had occurred for several years.</p>

<p>The Chinese, on this occasion, made every preparation in
their power; but that comprised very little except the everlasting
firing of crackers and beating of gongs, although they
endeavoured also to get shelter for their boats in the best way
they could. Our own ships prepared for the coming danger
as well as circumstances permitted, everything being made as
snug as possible. But the whole harbour was at this time
crowded with transports, store-ships, and merchant-ships, in
addition to our men-of-war and steamers; indeed, so close
were they anchored together, that in many cases there was not
even room to veer cable. It was evident to all, that if the
expected typhoon should burst upon them, the most serious
disasters would inevitably take place.</p>

<p>It was not without many misgivings and forebodings that,
in the midst of all the preparations for the storm, and when
there was every indication of its immediate outbreak, a small
schooner was observed to get under weigh, and stand out of
the harbour towards Macao; she had treasure on board, and
one or two passengers. She was never afterwards heard of;
not a vestige of her was ever discovered; she must have
foundered at sea at the very commencement of the storm.</p>

<p>During the night of the 20th, the weather was tolerably
calm, but ominously sultry; towards daylight on the 21st, it
became squally, with heavy rain, and a good deal of swell was
now getting up in the harbour. The barometer continued
gradually to fall, and the squalls became heavier. The
typhoon could no longer be doubted; and, as it was desirable
to move the Nemesis as much to windward of the other ships
as possible, steam was got up quickly, and with some difficulty
she was moved to a good berth on the opposite side, under
shelter of the high land above Cowloon. Topmasts were
lowered, and everything made snug, and she was brought up
with both bowers, open hawse, to the N.E., and veered to a
whole cable on each.</p>

<p>Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the wind
was blowing very hard from the northward, or directly upon
the shore of Hong-Kong, and continued to increase in heavy
squalls hour after hour. Ships were already beginning to
drive, and the work of destruction had commenced on every
side; the Chinese junks and boats were blown about in all
directions, and one of them was seen to founder with all hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
on board. The fine basin of Hong-Kong was gradually
covered with scattered wrecks of the war of elements; planks,
spars, broken boats, and human beings, clinging hopelessly
for succour to every treacherous log, were tossed about on
every side; the wind howled and tore everything away before
it, literally sweeping the face of the waters.</p>

<p>On shore, the hospital was one of the first buildings blown
down upon the heads of the unfortunate inmates, wounding
many, and aggravating the sufferings of all; yet only one
man, a helpless idiot, was killed. The buildings being merely
of temporary construction, most of them partly built of
bamboo, barracks and all came tumbling down like children's
card-houses.</p>

<p>From half-past ten until two the hurricane was at its
highest, the barometer at this time having descended to nearly
28.50 according to some, but on board the Nemesis it was
never lower than 28.89. The air was filled with spray and
salt, so that it was impossible to see anything that was not
almost close at hand. Ships were now drifting foul of each
other in all directions; masts were being cut away; and, from
the strength of the wind forcing the sea high upon the shore,
several ships were driven high and dry.</p>

<p>The native Chinese were all distracted, imploring their gods
in vain for help. Such an awful scene of destruction and
ruin is rarely witnessed; hundreds of Chinese were drowned,
and occasionally a whole family, children and all, floated past
the ships, clinging, in apparent apathy, (perhaps under the
influence of opium,) to the last remnants of their shattered
boats, which soon tumbled to pieces, and left them to their
fate.</p>

<p>During the height of the typhoon, the engines of the Nemesis
were kept going at half speed, and she rode through it
very easy, without suffering any damage. But even those few
vessels which did not drive were in constant danger of being
run foul of by others which did; in fact, crowded as the bay
was with shipping, it was a matter of wonder that even more
serious damage was not done than actually did occur. The
heaviest part of the typhoon appears certainly to have passed
directly over Hong-Kong, for even at Macao, which is only
thirty-five miles distant, it was much less severely felt, and,
moreover, there was a difference of nearly four hours in the
time of its occurrence; nevertheless, beyond Hong-Kong the
typhoon was also very severely felt, and several ships were
in the greatest danger.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that both our plenipotentiaries,
Captain Elliot and Sir Gordon Bremer, (who has recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
returned,) were wrecked on this occasion, and were only saved,
as it were, by a miracle. They were on their way to Hong-Kong,
in Captain Elliot's cutter, the Louisa, when the typhoon,
already commencing, compelled them to anchor in not a very
favourable berth, under one of the numerous islands at the
mouth of the Canton river. Every measure was resorted to
which good seamanship could suggest, to give any chance of
safety to the little vessel, but all in vain. She soon drove&mdash;her
spars and masts were carried away&mdash;a heavy, tumbling
sea broke over her, washing everything overboard&mdash;the destruction
of the vessel, and the loss of every one on board,
seemed to be inevitable. Fragments of the numerous wrecks
along the coast were floating past them every moment.
Having been driven from the island under which they first
took shelter, they were carried before the wind for the distance
of from two to three miles, expecting every moment to
be swallowed up; the commander had been already washed
overboard. At length they caught sight of land right ahead,
with a heavy surf breaking on it, apparently almost close to
them. The suspense at this moment was intense and awful.
If the vessel touched the surf, they would be launched into
eternity in a moment. But, providentially, the little cutter
cleared the breakers, almost within reach of their spray. The
anchor was now let go, but could not hold the little craft, so
heavily did the sea break over her; and at length she was
driven full upon the shore, where she instantly bilged and
filled. Some people now jumped overboard, others crawled
on to the nearest rocks, but at length all hands got safely on
shore, with the assistance of a rope, which one of the boys who
had succeeded in swimming ashore made fast to one of the
rocks.</p>

<p>Besides the plenipotentiaries, Lord Amelius Beauclerk and
one or two other gentlemen were partakers of these disasters.
There is little doubt that they all owed their preservation,
under Providence, to the admirable seamanship and cool presence
of mind of Captain Elliot himself, who took command
of the little vessel during the most trying period, and whose
accurate knowledge of the coast was of essential service.</p>

<p>Their troubles, however, were not yet at an end. They
managed to save very little provisions or clothing from the
wreck; and the only place they could discover, in which they
could shelter themselves for the night, was a large fissure in
the side of a precipice, open at the top, with a small mountain-stream
running through the centre of it. There they
anxiously awaited the dawn of morning, in a sitting posture,
(for they could not lie down,) and drenched to the skin. Soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
after daylight they discovered two Chinamen, who came down
to pillage the wreck; and several dead bodies of Chinamen
were found cast up upon the shore. After some hesitation
and difficulty, a bargain was at length made to convey Captain
Elliot, for one thousand dollars, to Macao, in a fishing-boat;
but, shortly afterwards, another party of Chinese fishermen,
coming up from a neighbouring village, commenced robbing
all the shipwrecked people, stripping them of their clothes,
and, among other things, getting possession of a star of the
Hanoverian Guelphic Order. In a short time, the demand
for conveying Captain Elliot to Macao, as soon as the weather
would permit, was raised to two thousand dollars, which was
agreed to.</p>

<p>Yet difficulties seemed to multiply hourly; for, at this juncture,
some of the Chinese, having found two or three bodies
of their countrymen lashed to spars, and dreadfully lacerated
by being dashed against the rocks until they were lifeless, took
it for granted that this had been done purposely by Captain
Elliot and his party, and for some time their threatening gestures
and angry looks of retaliation seemed to portend bloodshed.
This was, however, at length averted; and, ultimately,
after agreeing to pay upwards of three thousand dollars, Captain
Elliot, Sir Gordon Bremer, and two other persons, were
laid upon their backs, in the bottom of a boat, and carefully
covered over with mats. Scarcely, however, had they fairly
got away from the island, when another misfortune threatened
to consign them to the most bitter fate. An armed mandarin-boat
passed close by them, and hailed the Chinese boatmen,
asking for news about the wrecks. What a prize was at this
moment within their grasp! No less than twenty thousand
dollars had been already offered as a reward for the capture
either of Captain Elliot or Sir Gordon Bremer. Had the
boatmen been treacherous enough to betray their charge, (and
Captain Elliot was personally known to them,) what a grand
display her Majesty's two plenipotentiaries would have made
in Pekin, carried about in bamboo cages, like wild beasts!
What proclamations and boastings! What promotions and
rewards! But, happily, this was not to be; and, in a few
hours, the party landed safely in the inner harbour of Macao;
Captain Elliot having for his costume a jacket, without any
shirt; the commodore, a blue worsted frock; and each of them
a pair of striped trousers. To crown all, in this unhappy
plight, the moment the two high functionaries were recognised
by the Portuguese officer of the guard, the latter were ordered
to "turn out," as a mark of <i>respect</i>; but were soon induced
to defer it until a more fitting opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Boats were now sent off, without delay, together with an
interpreter, in order to rescue the other sufferers; and at last
they all arrived safely in Macao, on the 25th of July.</p>

<p>But it is time to return from this digression to the harbour
of Hong-Kong, just at the time when the height of the typhoon
had passed over. Towards noon the wind veered round a
little to the southward of east; at two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, it began to moderate;
and at three <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, its severity had past. Before sunset,
the haze began to clear off a little, and gradually the scene of
devastation became more and more visible, and presented such
a frightful spectacle, that you could hardly believe that it was
the same harbour of Hong-Kong, which had been recently so
gay and tranquil, with crowds of shipping upon the smooth
surface of its waters. The shore was covered with wrecks and
stranded boats, and the temporary buildings on shore had
disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Many of our ships were now found to be missing, having
been driven out to sea during the fury of the gale. Among
the latter was H.M. schooner, Starling, about which great
apprehensions were entertained. It was feared that she might
have foundered, with all hands on board.</p>

<p>On the following morning, at daylight, the Nemesis was
ordered to go out and render assistance to any vessels in distress,
and to bring off people from the wrecks; and particularly
to look out for the Starling, in case she should have gone
on shore upon any of the neighbouring islands. In every
direction immediate assistance was required, and many poor
fellows were rescued by the Nemesis from a watery grave.</p>

<p>It was curious to remark how completely every vessel that
had gone on shore was torn to pieces, and in so short a space
of time; every part of them was broken up, and the fragments
were floating about the harbour and lining the shores on every
side, above high-water mark. A number of artillerymen and
sappers were taken off the wreck of one of our prize war-junks
which had gone on shore; and the whole crew of the Prince
George merchant ship were likewise saved from one of the
neighbouring islands upon which they had been wrecked; but
the captain of the vessel refused to leave the island, where he
vainly persisted in seeking for the body of his unfortunate
wife, who was drowned when first the vessel struck.</p>

<p>Not being able to gain any tidings of the Starling, the
Nemesis proceeded on through the Capsingmoon passage,
towards Lintin, in the hope that she might have taken refuge
under that island. Fortunately, she was now descried beating
up gallantly through the passage towards Hong-Kong, and,
as soon as the steamer ran alongside, there was a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
cheer of congratulation. The tale was very soon told. During
the height of the typhoon, the Starling had parted a cable,
and, as she was now drifting fast, Captain Kellett at once
slipped the other, in the hope of being able to run through
the Capsingmoon passage, as his only chance of safety. With
very great exertion and good seamanship, he fortunately succeeded
in the attempt, even in the midst of the typhoon, and
had even managed to lie-to and pick up some unfortunate
Chinamen, who were floating past him upon the wreck of
their shattered junk. At length, he succeeded in getting under
the lee of the island of Lintin, where he brought up with a
common boat's anchor, having a couple of guns fastened to
the cable. By the aid of this contrivance, he rode out the
gale, until it moderated sufficiently for him to get under
weigh, and attempt to return to Hong-Kong. The Nemesis,
however, now took the Starling in tow, and great was the surprise
and joy of every one at Hong-Kong, when the two vessels
were seen standing in together in safety.</p>

<p>In this typhoon, H.M.S. Sulphur, Algerine, Royalist, and
the schooner Hebe, were dismasted; and at least twenty
merchant vessels and transports were either driven ashore or
were dismasted, and suffered other injuries.</p>

<p>Five days afterwards, on the 26th, there was a recurrence of
the typhoon, which the Nemesis rode out very easily in the
Typa anchorage at Macao; but it was not so severe as the
first one, and comparatively little injury was caused by it.
There is reason to believe also, that, had all the ships at
Hong-Kong been moored in proper berths, and early precautions
taken, before the commencement of the first typhoon,
the danger and the damage inflicted would have been much
less severe.</p>

<p>No time was lost in refitting the ships, and preparations
were now hastened for the advance of our forces upon Amoy,
and for pushing on our operations further northward, while
the favourable season lasted. Sir Gordon Bremer had returned
from Calcutta, in the Queen steamer, on the 18th of June,
having been invested with the functions of joint-plenipotentiary,
in conjunction with Captain Elliot. This high honour
was, however, of short duration; for, on the 9th of August,
Sir Henry Pottinger arrived from England, <i>via</i> Bombay, having
been appointed sole plenipotentiary and chief-superintendent
of trade in China: he was accompanied by Vice-Admiral Sir
William Parker, by whom all the subsequent naval operations
were conducted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>At the end of July, the H.C. steamer Phlegethon, Lieut.
M'Cleverty, nearly the exact counterpart of the Nemesis,
arrived at Hong-Kong, bringing the intelligence that Captain
Elliot's treaty of Chuenpee had been disapproved of by the
home government, and that Sir Henry Pottinger had been
appointed to succeed him, as sole plenipotentiary. Shortly
before this, also, her Majesty's 55th regiment had arrived
from Calcutta, and everything indicated that a movement upon
Amoy would take place as soon as possible, after the expected
arrival of Sir Henry Pottinger as plenipotentiary, and Sir
William Parker as admiral. The season for active operations
was already advanced, and even for the sake of the health of
the troops, it was the anxious wish of all the officers that a
change of some sort or other might speedily take place.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 10th of August, the arrival of the
H.C. steamer Sesostris, from Bombay, in the Macao roads,
was announced, and great was the joy of every one when it
was made known that both Sir Henry Pottinger and Sir William
Parker were on board. They had come from London
in the wonderfully short period of sixty-seven days, ten of
which had been spent in Bombay.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning, the Nemesis went out to convey
these high functionaries from the Sesostris, in the roads, to
the town of Macao, where they were received with every demonstration
of respect, under a salute from the Portuguese forts.
A conference was held in the course of the morning, between
Captain Elliot and Sir Henry Pottinger, together with the
Admiral and Sir Hugh Gough. Energetic measures appeared
to be at once resolved on. Sir William Parker went over to
visit the fleet at Hong-Kong, and as soon as visits of ceremony
had been exchanged between the new plenipotentiary
and the Portuguese authorities, Sir Henry Pottinger lost no
time in publishing the notification of his appointment, as
minister extraordinary and sole plenipotentiary, and also as
chief superintendent of trade in China.</p>

<p>In order to communicate officially to the Chinese authorities
the fact of his arrival, and the nature of his powers, Sir
Henry now despatched his secretary, Major Malcolm, to
Canton, as the bearer of letters to the provincial government.
The Nemesis was, as usual, employed to carry the officers up
the river. No little sensation was created among the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
officials by the announcement which was now made to them.
They therefore resolved to welcome the plenipotentiary with
all ceremony; and probably, also, in the hope of being able
to form some estimate of his character, they despatched the
prefect of the city, or kwang-chow-foo, on the 18th, to
Macao, with a numerous retinue. He landed at Macao, upon
the Praya Grande, near the governor's palace, attended by a
great number of followers, and proceeded in state to the residence
of the plenipotentiary, thinking, no doubt, that he was
conferring a great honour upon his Excellency, and that he
would accordingly be received with every mark of distinction.
Alas, how are the mighty fallen! The ceremonious prefect
was not even <i>received</i>. He, who had hitherto been courted
as an officer of distinction, and had been the medium of communication,
and in some sort the ambassador, between the
high Chinese authorities and Captain Elliot, was now absolutely
<i>rejected</i>. Sir Henry Pottinger, acting with an intimate
knowledge of the Oriental character, and fully impressed with
the high duties he was called upon to perform, and the high
station he had to maintain as her Majesty's representative,
declined to receive or hold any direct intercourse with an
officer inferior to himself in rank and responsibility, and still
less with one of comparatively inferior grade, such as the
Prefect of Canton.</p>

<p>Major Malcolm, the secretary of legation, was, however,
deputed to receive the prefect; and, after a short interview,
the would-be great man withdrew, and returned in some
dismay to Canton, to report the circumstances to his superiors.
The sensation created by this little characteristic incident was
very remarkable. It became the subject of conversation in
every quarter, and tended to awaken much greater respect for
the dignity of the new plenipotentiary. The same cautious
and dignified bearing was maintained with the greatest advantage
throughout the whole of our subsequent proceedings.</p>

<p>At Hong-Kong, the most active preparations were now
being made for the immediate departure of the expedition.
Excellent arrangements were introduced by Sir William
Parker for the proper guidance of the fleet, and especially for
the distribution and management of the numerous transports
and store-ships. The advantage of this systematic regularity
soon became evident; and it is deserving of notice that, from
this period to the close of the war, the transport service was
conducted with the utmost regularity and efficiency, in spite of
the endless difficulties arising out of our imperfect knowledge
of the coast of China, and the inaccuracy of most of the charts.
Add to this, that owing to sickness and other causes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
transports were often under-manned, and had frequently the
most arduous duties to perform.</p>

<p>By a general order of the 19th of August, issued only nine
days after the arrival of the admiral, the fleet was directed to
be ready to put to sea at daylight on the 21st. It was to
be formed in three divisions: the centre commanded by
Captain Herbert, in the Blenheim, assisted by Commander
Clarke, of the Columbine; the starboard division, under
Captain Bourchier, in the Blonde, assisted by Commander
Gifford, in the Cruiser; while the second, or port division,
was placed under Captain Smith, of the Druid, assisted by
Commander Anson, of the Pylades.</p>

<p>The whole fleet consisted of thirty-six sail, including
transports&mdash;namely, two line-of-battle ships, the Wellesley
and the Blenheim; seven other ships of war&mdash;namely, the
Modeste, Druid, Columbine, Blonde, Pylades, Cruiser, and
Algerine; the Rattlesnake troop-ship, and the Bentinck surveying
vessel; four steamers belonging to the East India
Company&mdash;namely, the Queen, Phlegethon, Nemesis, and
Sesostris; and twenty-one hired transports and store-ships,
most of them of large size, several of not less than a thousand
tons burden. The force stationed in the neighbourhood of
the Canton river comprised five or six vessels of war, including
the Herald and Alligator, and was under the command of
Captain Nias, senior officer.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 21st, the fleet got under
weigh. Sir Henry Pottinger came over from Macao, in The
Queen, on that day, just as the fleet had sailed; and, as he
stopped some time at Hong-Hong to inspect the place, and
examine the various arrangements which had already been
made, he did not join the admiral until the following day.
The general rendezvous, in case of separation, was to be
Chapel Island, not far from Amoy. The weather was
extremely favourable during the whole passage up, and, on
the 25th, the whole squadron reached the outer harbour of
Amoy, having preserved the order of sailing remarkably well
throughout.</p>

<p>The late plenipotentiaries, Captain Elliot and Sir Gordon
Bremer, sailed from Hong-Kong, and finally took leave of
China, three days after the departure of the expedition, on
board the Atalanta steamer, which had become completely
knocked up by her work in the Canton river. Their intention
was to proceed as quickly as possible to England, by way of
Bombay.</p>

<p>The distance of Amoy from Hong-Kong is scarcely three
hundred miles, and there were many good grounds for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
making it the first point of attack, as the expedition proceeded
northward. It could not be doubted that the capture of this
flourishing commercial city would be seriously felt by the
Chinese government. The authorities had, within the last
twelve months, spent enormous sums of money and incredible
labour in the construction of batteries, which they deemed
impregnable, and which were certainly capable of being
stoutly defended.</p>

<p>The harbour of Amoy is situated in the south-western corner of
an island of the same name, which, together with another called
Quemoy, occupies a considerable portion of a large bay, in
which, however, there are also numerous smaller islands. Of
these, the most interesting, in connexion with our present
subject, is that of Kolingsoo, which is separated from Amoy
by a narrow passage, leading directly up to the harbour. In
fact, the possession of this island, which we still retain, gives
us the complete command of Amoy itself, or rather of its town
and suburbs.</p>

<p>The scenery within the bay and about the town of Amoy is
exceedingly picturesque, the appearance of the country being
very mountainous and striking. Several considerable rivers
pour their waters into the bay, and facilitate the communications
with the interior of the country. The superiority of the
harbour much exceeded the expectations of the officers.</p>

<p>The town of Amoy, although possessed of great commercial
importance, and very wealthy, is by no means a first-class
city&mdash;it ranks, indeed, only as a principal third-class town&mdash;but
its inhabitants are exceedingly enterprising and intelligent,
and are remarkable for a certain disposition for emigration
and colonization, as well as for their love of commerce. They
were the principal colonizers of the flourishing island of
Formosa, which lies opposite Amoy, extending itself along the
coast for a distance of little less than two hundred miles; and
they are to be found in great numbers in more remote islands,
subject even to foreign dominion, such as Java, Singapore,
Manilla, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The city and suburbs of Amoy can hardly be less than eight
or ten miles in circumference, and they are in a great degree
commanded by a fortified hill or citadel in the rear, which,
however, is again commanded (as is very commonly the case
in China) by unfortified heights beyond it to the eastward.
The suburbs, or outer town, are separated from the principal
or inner town by a line of steep, rocky hills, which run transversely
down to the beach; but a paved road or narrow causeway
leads into the city, through a pass which is protected by
a covered gateway at its summit. As there is, therefore, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
may be called a double town, so is there also a sort of double
harbour&mdash;the outer one running along the face of the outer
town, and the inner one extending along the front of the
principal town, and joining a large estuary, which runs deep
into the island across its centre, and skirts the northern side
of the city. In this manner, nearly two-thirds of the city of
Amoy are washed by the sea. In fact, it stands upon a corner
or tongue of land, having a line of bold mountains in its rear
and on its flank. The walls are castellated at top, and vary
in height, according to the nature of the ground, from twenty
to thirty feet. There are also, as in other places, four principal
gates, having each an outwork or outer wall, with a
court or open space between them, and a second gate leading
from this, and placed at right angles to the inner one, so that
the approach to it from the outside is commanded by the
principal wall of the town.</p>

<p>The citadel of Amoy was afterwards found to contain a
large supply of military accoutrements&mdash;ginjals, matchlocks,
swords, shields, and spears of all kinds; there was also an
immense quantity of gunpowder, and materials for making it;
in short, there was every reason to believe that Amoy had
been made use of as the great military depôt of the province.</p>

<p>It is impossible to form even a tolerable estimate of the
number of troops collected for the defence of the place, but
the different accounts which were received varied from six
thousand to eight or ten thousand men. It was also known
that the high officers of the province had come down to Amoy
purposely to encourage the defence, and to witness, as they
hoped, the utter discomfiture of the barbarians. It was, however,
upon their newly-constructed works that they placed
their great reliance.</p>

<p>Numerous forts and field-works had been erected upon
nearly all the smaller islands which stretch across the mouth
of the great bay; and upon the island of Amoy itself a succession
of batteries and field-works had been built to command
the approach to the town. The principal of these was
a long stone battery, well built of granite, <i>faced with earth</i>,
extending along the shore nearly up to the suburbs of the
city, and designed to command the passage to the harbour.
It presented a line of guns a full mile in length, the embrasures
being covered with large slabs of stone protected by
earth heaped upon them, and mounting no less than ninety-six
guns. In the rear of this battery there was a range of
steep, rocky heights, up the side of which the Chinese had
carried a strong castellated wall to serve as a flanking defence
to the battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Still further to defend the approaches to the city, they had
also strongly fortified the little island of Kolingsoo, between
which and Amoy the passage is not more than six hundred
yards across; this island is, in fact, the key of Amoy, and
was retained in our possession when the city and the island
of Amoy were restored to the Chinese. At that time the
Chinese had already mounted upon the works, either completed
or in progress, no less than seventy-six guns. Indeed
they had spared no labour to endeavour to render Amoy
capable of easy defence; although, from want of skill and
discipline, the resistance which they offered was comparatively
trifling. If the number of guns alone could indicate the
strength of a place, the Chinese might have had some grounds
for confidence; for, as Sir Hugh Gough remarked, "every
island, every projecting headland whence guns could be made
to bear, was occupied and strongly armed." In fact, there
were altogether not less than five hundred guns captured at
Amoy and the adjacent islands.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 26th of August, everything
was in readiness for the projected attack. The captains and
commanders repaired on board the flag-ship for orders; the
steamers were all smoking and blowing off their spare steam,
and the officers were all anxiously looking for the expected
signal to stand in and engage the batteries. Before active
operations commenced, however, it was thought right to make
a reconnoissance of the defences which were to be attacked.
With this view Sir Hugh Gough, Sir William Parker, and the
plenipotentiary, stood in on board the Phlegethon, and were
able to approach sufficiently close to the works to observe all
that was necessary, without having a single shot fired at
them.</p>

<p>In the meantime a messenger, supposed to be a Chinese merchant,
came off from the town, under a flag of truce, requesting to
know the object of the visit of so large and formidable a squadron.
The answer to this question was simple enough, and was sent
in the name of the plenipotentiary, the general, and the
admiral, to the effect that "they required that the demands
made last year at Tientsin, (near Pekin,) by Captain Elliot,
should be complied with; and that hostile measures would, if
necessary, be adopted to enforce them. Nevertheless, that as
the plenipotentiary and the commanders-in-chief were moved
by compassionate feelings, and were unwilling to cause the
death of so many officers and soldiers as must perish, they
were willing to allow all the officers and troops in the town to
retire with their personal arms and baggage, in order to save
the people from being hurt, upon condition that the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and fortifications of Amoy should be at once delivered into
the hands of the British forces, to be held for the present by
them." A white flag was to be exhibited from the fortifications,
if these terms were acceded to; otherwise, hostilities
would commence. As might be expected, the white flag was
not displayed.</p>

<p>The morning was very hot and sultry; but about one
o'clock a steady, favourable breeze set in, and the squadron
got under weigh. The plan was, to make a simultaneous
attack upon all the batteries at once, both against those upon
Amoy and those upon Kolingsoo. The troops were also to
be landed, with the object of taking the batteries in the rear;
and the Nemesis and Phlegethon steamers were to be employed
to convey them to the appointed place of debarkation.</p>

<p>The ships were likely to bear the chief brunt of the engagement;
but Sir Hugh Gough made every disposition for the
employment of the land forces, and his general order, issued
just before the attack was to take place, deserves especial
notice. He directed his remarks very strongly to the question
of plundering; and observed, that "as Amoy was a large
commercial port, and there had once been an English factory
there, it was highly important that no act should be committed
which could tend to embarrass our future friendly
intercourse. The government and the military were to be
overcome, and public property taken possession of, under
certain instructions, but <i>private property</i> was to be held inviolable;
and that which in England," observed the general,
"obtains the name of robbery, deserves no better name in
China." The camp followers were made liable to be <i>put to
death</i> for plundering; and orders were issued to punish on
the spot any man straggling from his corps.</p>

<p>This alone will suffice to point out that the expedition was
very far from possessing that buccaneering character which
some persons, particularly foreigners, attempted to cast upon
it. Indeed, it may safely be asserted, that war was never
carried on with so little infliction of suffering upon the people
generally as in China. Generally speaking, the people soon
learned to appreciate our motives; and unless prevented by
their <i>own officers</i>, they commonly shewed a friendly, or at all
events a neutral feeling towards us. Besides the English,
the privilege of trading at Amoy was formerly held by the
Spanish also; and, at no very remote period, a regular intercourse
was kept up between Amoy and the Spanish colony of
Manilla.</p>

<p>It was probable that the nature of the country round Amoy
would render brigade movements inadmissible; but the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
were to be prepared to form in three brigades, if necessary.
The men were to land in jackets, caps, and coats folded; and
were to carry, each man, one day's cooked provisions. The
artillery were to be in readiness to land their light, mountain
guns.</p>

<p>About half-past one, the attack commenced on our side;
but the Chinese had already begun the engagement, by firing
occasional shots at our ships, as they proceeded with a steady
and favourable breeze to their respective stations. The
Sesostris and Queen steamers led in; the former commencing
the action, but receiving a heavy fire before she returned it.
The line-of-battle ships, Wellesley and Blenheim, under
Captains Maitland and Herbert, proceeded to the extremity of
the long stone battery, nearest the suburbs, where they anchored
by the stern, about half-past two P.M., within four hundred
yards of the works, and at once opened a heavy fire upon the
principal battery.</p>

<p>The next in order along the front of these works, from the
suburbs towards the outer extremity, were the Pylades,
Columbine, Cruiser, and Algerine. Simultaneously with this
attack upon Amoy, the Blonde, Druid, and Modeste, reached
their allotted stations, against the works of Kolingsoo; but,
owing to the shallowness of the water, they were boldly carried
on, in little more than their own draught.</p>

<p>The roar of the artillery on every side, echoed by the
mountains around, was now terrific; and in one hour and
twenty minutes the three principal batteries on Kolingsoo
were silenced, and the marines under Captain Ellis, about one
hundred and seventy in number, were landed on that island,
and took possession of the heights in the rear, without any
loss. Three companies of the 26th regiment had also been
appointed to this service, but the distance of the transports
only permitted a small detachment of them, under Major
Johnstone, to land in time to assist in clearing the batteries.
The small detachment of the Royal Artillery, under Lieut.
the Hon. R. E. Spencer, were actively employed on board the
Blonde, during the attack.</p>

<p>While these operations were being carried on against the
batteries on Kolingsoo, and against the long battery on Amoy,
the Phlegethon and Nemesis were speedily brought up with
the troops ready to land. The Nemesis had taken on board
the general and his staff, together with the 18th Royal Irish,
under Colonel Adams; and had also to tow up a number of
boats, with the sappers and miners, followers, &amp;c. Considerable
delay was therefore occasioned by having to run up to the
different transports to embark detachments, and also to pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
up the boats; and it was not until half-past three that the
Nemesis could get into action. She then opened fire at the
long battery with her heavy guns and rockets, as she approached
the lower angle of the fort for the purpose of landing
the troops.</p>

<p>It was just about this time, that as the Phlegethon was also
running up towards the battery, a boat was despatched by
Lieut. M'Cleverty, in which Lieut. Crawford volunteered his
services to capture a small outwork upon a hill, very near the
beach; and it was here that the British flag was first displayed
upon the enemy's works, on that day, with three cheers from
the steamers.</p>

<p>About a quarter before four, the general landed upon the
beach, near the flank of the great battery, with the 18th and
49th regiments, which were carried in by the Nemesis and
Phlegethon steamers. The disembarkation was conducted by
Commander Giffard, of the Cruiser. The 18th was directed
to escalade the castellated wall which flanked the battery;
and, as already described, ran up the hill-side from the beach,
nearly at right angles to it. At the same time, the 49th were
to move along the beach towards the lower angle of the
battery, and either get over it at its sea-face, or force their
way through the embrasures.</p>

<p>A smart fire was kept up from the Nemesis, to cover the
landing and advance of the troops; and Capt. Hall himself,
anxious to take an active part in every operation, pushed off
from the steamer, in the pinnace manned and armed, accompanied
by the unfortunate Mr. Gully, who, as an old and brave
friend, volunteered to go with him. This was the same
gentleman who afterwards fell a victim to the rapacity and
cruelty of the Chinese authorities on the island of Formosa,
upon which he had the misfortune to be wrecked, and, after
seven months' imprisonment and cruel treatment, was at length
executed, together with nearly all his companions.</p>

<p>As soon as Capt. Hall and his friend had landed with the
pinnace's crew, they joined the advanced guard of the 18th,
under Major Tomlinson and Lieut. Murray, who were advancing
towards the lower end of the castellated wall. The Chinese
opened a smart fire of ginjals and matchlocks as they approached,
which was returned by the advancing party, who
took advantage of the numerous little hillocks and tombs
which lay in their way, to shelter themselves while they reloaded.</p>

<p>The Chinese, finding their enemy pressing up towards the
wall, and being already bewildered by the admirable firing of
the ships, now began to slacken their fire. The 18th rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
for the lower end of the wall, while the party from the Nemesis
made a dash at its flank, some way higher up, near a gateway,
where the wall appeared less elevated and more accessible.
They had, however, brought no scaling-ladders, and, in order
to get over the wall, the men were obliged to be lifted up on
each other's backs. In this way Captain Hall managed to get
first upon the top of the wall, and instantly waved the British
flag (which on such occasions he always carried with him in
his pocket) in token of triumph. Others soon followed; and
the Chinese, the moment they saw their enemies upon the
walls, fired two or three random shots, and fled. At this time
also the 18th got over the wall lower down, while the 49th
forced their way through the embrasures, just at the angle of
the sea-face of the great battery. The fire of the ships had
not yet ceased, when the party from the Nemesis got down
into the body of the fort, and several of our large shot fell
close around them.</p>

<p>A very short distance in advance they now observed that
two Chinese officers of high rank, mounted on horseback,
were endeavouring to make their escape, surrounded by a
numerous body-guard, or retinue. The opportunity for
trying to take an important prisoner was a tempting one;
and Captain Hall, little thinking how few of his own men
were near him, and carried away by the impulse of the moment,
rushed headlong upon the Chinese soldiers in front of
him, firing off his pistols at the two principal officers. Only
two of his own men were near him at the moment; so that
one of the inferior Chinese officers, seeing the disparity,
rallied a few of his men, and suddenly faced about, with a
view to cut them off. A personal encounter now took place
with the Chinese officer, who was a remarkably fine young
man, bearing the white button. The long sword, however,
soon had the advantage over the Chinese short one, even
putting aside personal prowess, and the mandarin fell severely
wounded in the arm. He was immediately disarmed, and his
cap and button, together with his sword, were taken from him
as trophies. Several other soldiers now came up, to endeavour
to rescue their officer, who got up and tried to escape, but
another wound in the leg soon brought him down again, and
made the other Chinamen halt.</p>

<p>By this time, Captain Hall and his two men were nearly
surrounded, and were compelled to fight their way back again
towards their comrades, who were coming up to their aid.
One of the two seamen received a severe wound in the groin
from the thrust of a spear, but the others got off without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
injury. The young wounded mandarin was at last safely
carried off by his comrades.</p>

<p>The Chinese were now in full flight in every direction,
followed by the 18th, 49th, and a party of small-arm men,
who were landed from the Wellesley and Blenheim, some way
up the sea-face of the fort, under Commander Fletcher and
other officers of those ships. The fort was soon completely
in our possession. During all the operations of this day, Sir
Henry Pottinger and suite were with the admiral on board
the Wellesley.</p>

<p>On examining the sea-face of the battery, it was impossible
not to be struck with the amazing solidity of the wall. It
was composed of hewn granite, faced outside with earth, and
of such strength, that the heavy firing of two line-of-battle
ships against it, at the distance of only four hundred yards,
had made very little impression; indeed, it might be said to
be shot-proof. The embrasures were something like low
port-holes, covered with stone and earth, and in the space
between them were sheds, or a sort of temporary watch-boxes,
in which was found a quantity of arms of every kind, clothes,
half-cooked food, and also <i>opium</i>, with the common pipes used
for smoking it. A horse also was found. The guns were
many of them very ill-mounted, and in general the carriages
were badly contrived, and often defective. In some places
you saw bags of sand placed upon the top of the guns, to
prevent them from jumping out of the carriages altogether.
The fort had evidently been armed hastily.</p>

<p>Several high Chinese officers fell during this day; some
probably by their own hands. One of them very quietly
rushed into the water and drowned himself, although, in the
report of the affair to the emperor, it was afterwards stated
that he "rushed on to drive back the assailants as they landed,
and <i>fell into the water</i> and died." This officer was the Chinese
commodore, who commanded in the absence of the <i>admiral</i>.
This officer had left the port just before our arrival, (boasting
that he was going to <i>meet</i> the barbarians,) and, having sailed
northward, could not get back again, owing to the contrary wind.</p>

<p>Before five o'clock, the whole of the outer defences of Amoy
were in our possession. The Blonde and Modeste, as soon as
they had silenced the batteries on Kolingsoo, with the assistance
of the Druid, had pushed on into the inner harbour, and
captured twenty-six war-junks, mounting not less than one
hundred and twenty-eight guns; they were nearly ready for
sea, but were deserted by their crews. A large building-yard
was discovered, with an immense quantity of timber collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
in it; and there was a good-sized frigate-junk, of about three
hundred tons, in course of building, in a regular dry dock,
something after the European model; they had evidently
made a great step in advance in the art of ship-building;
indeed, the longer the war lasted, the more the Chinese found
themselves led on, by the "impulse of necessity," to attempt
great changes, and, in many respects, improvements, not only
in their vessels, but in their warlike weapons, and other
matters relating to the art of defence.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, in running along the shore to avoid the
swell which was setting in, unexpectedly found herself within
a circular patch of coral rock, which was not visible above the
surface. Several fruitless attempts were made to extricate her
from this curious position, but the entrance by which she had
got into it could not again be found; but her draught of
water being very small, it was thought likely she would be
able to force her way over the reef without suffering much
damage to her iron hull, and she dashed at it at half speed.
The blow, however, was more severe than was expected; the
vessel bounded completely over the reef; but the sharp coral
rock cut completely through her bottom, making a considerable
leak in the engine-room. This was fortunately stopped
from the <i>inside</i> without much difficulty, and no further notice
was taken of it until some time afterwards, when she arrived
at Chusan, where the damage was substantially repaired.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sir Hugh Gough pushed on without
delay, to occupy a chain of steep, rocky hills, which, running
transversely down to the beach, lay between the great fort and
the town, so as to intercept the view of the latter. A strong
body of the Chinese seemed disposed to defend this position,
which was naturally of great strength, and completely commanded
the approach to the city. Immediate advantage was
to be taken of the prevailing panic; and the 18th and 49th
regiments being directed to advance partly up a steep gorge,
and partly by a more circuitous road leading round the hills,
soon made themselves masters of the heights overlooking the
city. The Chinese retreated before them as soon as they had
fired off their guns and matchlocks. Our troops bivouacked
for the night upon the positions they occupied; but they
might have been a good deal harassed by the Chinese, if the
latter had taken advantage of the rocky, broken character of
the ground, to dispute their further advance. The night was
bitterly cold upon the heights.</p>

<p>At daylight a reconnoissance was made, and it was soon discovered
that little resistance was to be expected. Great confusion
and bustle were apparent in all directions; hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the inhabitants were hurrying out of the northern gate,
carrying with them their most valuable property; in fact,
there was evidently a general panic. Without loss of time,
therefore, the 18th, supported by the 49th, were ordered to
march down towards the city in the direction of the eastern
gate, which was the nearest, while Captain Cotton, the commanding
engineer, was directed to examine carefully the approaches
to the gate itself.</p>

<p>The advanced party of the 18th, on arriving at the gate,
found that there was no preparation for resistance, and soon
scaled the walls by means of some ladders which were very
opportunely found not far from the gate. Heaps of rubbish, and
sacks full of earth and sand, were found piled up inside against
the gate, so that some time was required to get it open. It
was now discovered that the authorities and all the soldiers
had abandoned the town, leaving everything in the utmost
disorder, so that the only protection which the more respectable
and peaceably-inclined inhabitants had to look for, from
the violence and plundering of <i>their own rabble</i>, was from the
presence of our own troops, and the military government of
the city by the victorious captors. Already the mob had
begun to ransack some of the public establishments before we
found out where they were situated; and it was afterwards
discovered that a good deal of treasure must have been carried
away by the thieves and vagabonds of the town. A number
of men were found carrying out of the gates something
having the appearance of common logs of wood; and it was
not suspected, until too late, that these logs were hollowed
out, and filled with Sycee silver, a very ingenious contrivance
to escape detection. A small quantity of treasure was found
in one of the large buildings, supposed to be the office of the
commandant, which was occupied by the sappers and miners.</p>

<p>Most of the public offices were large and roomy buildings,
affording good accommodation for a whole regiment of
soldiers. The pile of buildings belonging to the admiral's
department was assigned to the 18th and the staff, being
within the walled town; while the 49th were quartered in the
outer town, in a large building belonging to the office of the
Intendant of Circuit. The 55th occupied an extensive range
of buildings belonging to the Prefect of Amoy; the artillery
retaining possession of a commanding position overlooking
both the city and the outer town.</p>

<p>Late in the day, and also on the following morning, Sir
Henry Pottinger and Sir William Parker landed, to take a
view of the town; but, after visiting the principal buildings,
they returned on board ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous patrols were found necessary, by day and night,
in order to preserve quiet in the public streets, and to check
the boldness and rapacity of the swarms of Chinese thieves
and rogues, who hovered about like a raging pestilence in
every part of the city, and crowded in from the country the
moment the respectable inhabitants left the town. The inhabitants
themselves were, in many instances, afraid even to
defend their own property, or to aid our troops in restoring
order and regularity; they dreaded the probable imputation
of having traitorously aided the foreigners, and the fear of
extortion and punishment from their own authorities, at some
future period, served to disorganize the whole community. In
vain did Sir Hugh Gough appeal to the more respectable
merchants and householders to aid him in protecting property;
all that he could get from them was empty promises,
of which they were very liberal, but from which no good
result followed. Even within the citadel, or walled town, it
was with the utmost difficulty that the daring thieves and
vagabonds could be kept in check; and hardly could even a
single Chinaman be induced to point out to the guards at the
gate the real <i>bonâ fide</i> owners of houses or property, in order
that they might be allowed free egress and ingress.</p>

<p>The injury which the inhabitants of many Chinese towns
suffered during our operations must not be estimated by the
actual damage (generally trifling) done by our fire, or by the
presence of our troops. In most instances, even before
hostilities commenced, the presence of the <i>Chinese troops</i>, who
were marched in probably from several distant provinces,
became almost a scourge to the inhabitants; and afterwards,
when a town was taken, and the local government disorganized,
much greater damage was done to the property of
the people by the low mob of plunderers, than would, under
any circumstances, have been allowed by our own victorious
soldiers; indeed, some instances occurred in which the former
were shot by our guards, rather than desist from their evil
doings.</p>

<p>Our men often resisted temptations of no ordinary kind;
houses were found abandoned, property left unprotected, shops
open, and goods strewed about; and even the abominable
spirit, samshu, (distilled from rice,) was sometimes almost
purposely placed in their way. The instances of misconduct
were few, even under these peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p>Among other discoveries was one calculated to corroborate
at first sight the notion of the prevalence of infanticide among
the Chinese. In a large tank near a public building, by some
supposed to have been an hospital, were found the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
bodies of several young infants which had been drowned,
having been thrown in, sewn up in pieces of mat. But there
was nothing to determine whether the horrid deed was done
out of fear that violence might be offered to the women and
children, or whether it was really an instance of the practice
of infanticide, which has been said to prevail in China to a
much greater extent than it really does. The former explanation
may possibly in this instance, as in some later ones,
be the true one.</p>

<p>The interior of the island of Amoy was not occupied, or
even examined, for it was feared by the general that the
presence of our troops would so much alarm the respectable
and influential inhabitants, that the whole place would be
given up to the rapacity and lawlessness of the innumerable
miscreants who watched for every opportunity of letting loose
all their bad propensities; but the Nemesis, accompanied by
the Algerine, and having in tow the launch and pinnace of
the Blonde, was ordered to steam round the island, and search
for war-junks. None, however, were found.</p>

<p>The island of Kolingsoo appeared so completely to command
the harbour and approach to Amoy, that the occupation
of that position only was calculated to answer every good purpose,
without the necessity for the retention of Amoy.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of Sir Henry Pottinger, in which the
general and the admiral perfectly coincided, that no measures
should be taken for the permanent occupation of the city, and
that a small garrison only should be left at Kolingsoo, while
the remainder of the expedition should move further northward
with the least possible delay. It was necessary, however,
to wait a day or two for favourable winds, and measures
were taken for the destruction of the numerous works which
had been constructed upon the outer islands.</p>

<p>The Nemesis was employed on this important service on the
30th and 31st. Having been joined by two launches and
other boats, with a party of seamen and marines from the
Wellesley, Blenheim, and Druid, under Commander Fletcher,
she proceeded to destroy some forts and guns, principally on
the south-west side of the bay, all of which had been abandoned
by the Chinese. On this occasion, five forts or field-works
and forty-two guns were taken possession of and destroyed,
and on the following day several others of the same
description were also disabled. A body of Chinese soldiers,
who shewed themselves near a small fort on the island of
Quemoy, at the eastern entrance of the bay, were dispersed,
and several guns, matchlocks, ginjals, &amp;c., together with a
quantity of gunpowder, were destroyed. Altogether seventy-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
guns and four forts were destroyed in this day's work,
and the admiral publicly spoke of the "very commendable
zeal" which had been displayed.</p>

<p>At Amoy, for the first time, the so-called tiger soldiers
shewed themselves&mdash;that is, men dressed up in yellow-coloured
clothes, with black spots or stripes upon them, and a covering
for the head, intended to be a rude representation of a tiger's
head, supposed to look very fierce, and to strike terror into
the minds of the enemy.</p>

<p>The island of Kolingsoo, which had been retained in our
possession ever since its capture, deserves a few remarks. It
is about a mile and a half in length, and about three quarters
of a mile broad, but is very irregular in its shape. It principally
consists of rocky broken ground, the greater part of
which is barren, but interspersed with unwholesome rice-grounds,
which have contributed to render the place extremely
unhealthy; indeed at one period the mortality among
the troops stationed there was dreadful, scarcely even a single
officer having escaped sickness, which proved fatal to many.
The Chinese, however, seemed to have suffered little from it,
for there were several neat and even elegant country-houses
upon the island, ornamented with handsome carved wood-work,
&amp;c. It seemed to have been used as a place of retirement
for some of the wealthier citizens of Amoy, and our
retention of a place so conveniently situated for giving us
the command of the harbour and trade of the city was a source
of great annoyance, both to the authorities and to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>For a considerable time, very little communication was kept
up with the town, and it was scarcely safe to venture into it;
but since the peace, every disposition has been shewn to receive
us in a friendly manner, and the knowledge which many of
the Chinese merchants have acquired of our character and
habits, by trading with Singapore, will tend materially to
facilitate our future commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>Several American missionaries have resided at Kolingsoo,
and without doubt will, at no distant period, succeed in winning
the attention and good-will of many of the inhabitants of
Amoy. A boundless field has at length been opened for
missionary enterprise in the benighted empire of China; for,
although it cannot be said that the country has been made
completely accessible to the foreigner, still the hostility of the
government has been materially modified.</p>

<p>It rests with the Christian nations to profit <i>as Christians</i>,
by the opportunities which cannot fail to offer. Among a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
people so fond of reading and <i>thinking</i>, and so given to study
and inquiry as the Chinese generally are, the best possible
results are to be expected from the judicious teaching of
Christianity, and, above all, of Christian <i>practices</i>. If China
is really to be opened, it is to be effected by missionary enterprise
cautiously and judiciously, and, above all, not too
hastily applied.</p>

<p>The most valuable of all aids to these undertakings, is that
of medical knowledge, which may be considered as almost indispensable
to the proper character of a missionary in China.
The relief of bodily suffering (above all, in a country where
the medical art is so low as it is in China) softens the feelings
of our nature, and paves the way for kinder influences over
the mind itself. It will open the family mansion of the most
secluded and prejudiced Chinese, when words or doctrines
<i>first</i> propounded would meet an unwilling or perhaps a hostile
listener. Religious teaching and the practice of the healing
art, the comfort of the suffering mind, and the solace of the
tortured body, must go hand in hand in effecting the good
work of "opening" China.</p>

<p>Why is it that the Americans have taken precedence of the
English in this great and glorious work, since the commencement
of the war in particular? For many years, a talented
medical missionary, Dr. Parker, has dispensed his double
blessing upon the Chinese at Canton, and can testify the
gratitude of the people, from the highest to the lowest, and
the readiness with which they have accepted his counsel and
his teaching in both capacities. At Macao, Hong-Kong,
Kolingsoo, and Chusan, the Americans have alike preceded
us.</p>

<p>There is, however, one great and fatal error to be avoided;
and that is, the rivalry of religious sects among each other,
and the attempt to gain followers at the expense of each
other's tenets. It was this want of unanimity which in some
measure produced the decline of the influence of Roman-catholic
missionaries in China.</p>

<p>The garrison which was left by Sir Hugh Gough upon the
island of Kolingsoo consisted of three companies of the 26th
regiment, with a wing of the 18th, and a small detachment of
artillery, comprising altogether about five hundred and fifty
men; the whole under the command of Major Johnstone, of
the 26th; and the Druid, with the Pylades and Algerine,
were also to remain there, under the command of Captain
Smith, C.B., as a further support, to ensure the complete
command of the harbour of Amoy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 4th of September, the weather
having become calm and fine, the preconcerted signal for the
embarkation of the troops from the town and island of Amoy
was made on board the flag-ship. Upon this sudden order,
the troops were paraded in perfect regularity, without a single
instance of drunkenness or misconduct, after eight days of
harassing duty on shore, amid temptations of every kind.
Under the direction of Commander Giffard, of the Cruiser,
the whole force was embarked without any accident, by half-past
six o'clock, on board the Nemesis and other steamers,
which conveyed them out to their respective transports, in
readiness to sail on the following day. Not even a camp-follower
was left behind (and they are generally a very troublesome
class); but, in order to make sure that there was no
straggler, the Nemesis was afterwards sent in again to the
town to bring off any one that might accidentally have been
left. But the only straggler which was found, happened to
be a fine <i>fat bullock</i>, which was soon put on board the Nemesis
and carried off.</p>

<p>Every preparation was now completed for the departure of
our forces on the following morning, the 5th of September.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>All those persons who have visited Amoy, either out of
curiosity or on matters of business, appear to agree with each
other in regarding it as a place peculiarly adapted for the
extension of European trade. The mercantile spirit and
enterprise of its inhabitants, and their anxious desire to trade
with foreigners, when not held back by the arbitrary orders of
the mandarins, have been long known and recorded by several
travellers, before there was any prospect whatever of the trade
being opened. Mr. Gutzlaff observed respecting it, in the
account of his voyage along the coast&mdash;"Its excellent harbour
has made it from time immemorial one of the greatest emporiums
of the empire, and one of the most important markets
of Asia. Vessels can sail close up to the houses, load and
unload with the greatest facility, have shelter from all winds,
and in entering or leaving the port, experience no danger of
getting ashore. The whole adjacent country being sterile, the
inhabitants were forced to seek some means of subsistence
elsewhere. Endowed with an enterprising spirit, and unwearied
in the pursuit of gain, they visited all parts of the
Chinese empire, gradually became bold sailors, and settled as
merchants all along the coast. Thus they colonized Formosa,
which, from that period to this, has been their granary, and
visited and settled in the Indian archipelago, Cochin China,
and Siam. A population constantly overflowing, demanded
constant resources for their subsistence, and this they found
in colonization; and thus they spread themselves all along
the coast of China, up to Mantchou Tartary. As soon as the
colonists amass sufficient money, they return home, which
they leave again when all is spent." Elsewhere he says,
"Many of these merchants, settled in the northern parts of
China, return annually with their profits. It is not surprising,
therefore, that a large amount of Chinese shipping belongs to
Amoy merchants, and that the greater part of the capital
employed in the coasting trade is their property. Hence, even
this barren tract is become one of the richest in China, from
the enterprise of its inhabitants. Wherever the people go
they are rarely found in a state of abject poverty; on the contrary,
they are often wealthy, and command the trade of whole
islands and provinces, as well by their capital as by their
superior enterprise and industry."</p>

<p>The English, who had formerly a factory at Amoy, were
compelled to relinquish the trade by the severe extortions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
which they were subject. The Dutch continued it for a longer
time, but neglected it when their influence at Formosa ceased.
The natives of Amoy have always shewn themselves ready to
cultivate the friendship of foreigners, wherever they have been,
and in their dealings they have a character for honesty beyond
all other Chinese. They are more ambitious of successful
mercantile enterprise than of literary distinction or advancement,
which is generally so dear to a Chinaman.</p>

<p>The shops of Amoy are generally well supplied with the
necessaries and luxuries of life, the merchants are civil, and
although the town is neither handsome nor very cleanly, and
the population in some parts of it are densely crowded together,
still there are many fine houses, which indicate the possession
of wealth and consequence.</p>

<p>An immense trade is carried on between Amoy and the
island of Formosa, to which a great number of emigrants are
even still attracted from the province of Fokien. Before the
occupation of Hong-Kong was thought of, several proposals
were made for forming a British settlement upon Formosa,
as being conveniently situated for extending our trade with
the inhabitants, not only of the adjacent district of Fokien,
but of the whole coast of China. This suggestion was partly
encouraged by the recollection of the settlement which the
Dutch once possessed upon the island; but it seemed to be
forgotten that the Dutch were at length forcibly expelled, and
that the population having greatly increased since that period,
it is not likely that we should be suffered to retain possession
of any part of the island without being constantly harassed and
provoked to bloodshed; moreover, the privilege of trading
with Amoy does away with all probability of advantage to be
derived by direct trade with Formosa.</p>

<p>Among other proposals, that of a settlement upon the
Bonin islands (which are said already to belong to Great
Britain) was suggested, with a view to commercial enterprise
with China; and Mr. Tradescant Lay warmly supported this
notion. These islands were taken possession of by Captain
Beechey, of H.M.S. Blossom, in 1827, and they extend from
latitude 27°, 44', to 26°, 30' N., being about five days' sail from
the Lew-Chew islands, and three from Japan. In the course
of a few years, it is not improbable that Port St. George, the
principal harbour, may be resorted to, with the object of pushing
our trade even into Japan itself. At the present moment,
indeed, several Englishmen and other Europeans are settled
there, and are principally concerned in the whale fishery.
There are also a good many natives of the Sandwich Islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
at Port St. George. The islands are volcanic, but are rendered
productive with moderate cultivation.</p>

<p>It is worth while here to mention that the Bonin Islands
and the Sandwich Islands lie directly in the line of future intercourse
between China and the west coast of America, and that
it has been thought not improbable that a new route to China
may some day be opened, by way of California and the islands
above-named.</p>

<p>To return from this digression to the island of Formosa,
which has claimed our particular interest since the massacre
of so many of our shipwrecked countrymen by the authorities,
shortly before the termination of the late war. In this horrible
tragedy no less than two hundred and eighty-three human
beings were put to death in cold blood, without any other
crime than that of helplessness, and without any other object
than that of obtaining rewards by fabricated statements, and
honours by false pretences. Formosa was the last conquest of
the present Tartar dynasty, and even since it has been brought
under Chinese dominion, the rebellions and disturbances of
its unruly inhabitants have been a frequent source of alarm to
the government. The imperial troops have been frequently
defeated with great slaughter, and peace is said to have been
purchased by bribes more frequently than it has been won
by conquest. The aboriginal inhabitants are still numerous
in the mountain districts, and along some parts of the eastern
shores, but they, are said to be much oppressed by the Chinese
colonists, and also by the authorities.</p>

<p>When the Tartars first began the conquest of China, great
numbers of discontented spirits went over to Formosa from
the neighbouring provinces, and it has been recorded that one
hundred thousand people took refuge there. The island belongs
to the province of Fokien, along which it is situated at
a distance varying from seventy to one hundred and twenty
miles, the passage between it and the mainland being called
the Formosa Channel. The length of this island is about two
hundred and twenty miles, but the breadth of it is extremely
irregular. The Chinese population is at present supposed to
amount to about <i>two millions</i>, and is constantly on the increase,
by the accession of an influx of emigrants from the
mainland adjoining. They are attracted thither by the fertility
of the soil, and the great facilities for cultivating sugar
and rice, which are there grown to an extent sufficient to
supply a vast quantity of these necessary articles to the inhabitants
of the mainland, and to employ several hundred
trading junks in the traffic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that the Dutch contrived to establish
themselves upon the island of Formosa, and ultimately to
form a factory there, before the Tartar conquest, and before it
was regularly colonized by the Chinese. The Japanese also
partly contributed, though in small numbers, to colonize the
island. The Dutch had a small garrison at a place called
Tanshuy, or Tamsui, at the northern extremity of the island,
and another at Kelung, not very for from it. Their object
was to make use of their settlement as a depôt, or centre of
trade, from which their operations could be extended along
the coast of China and Japan. Their influence was, however,
of very short continuance, as they were ultimately completely
driven out of the island, after some few struggles, by the
famous pirate, Coxinga, in 1662, about thirty or forty years
after they had fairly established themselves on it.</p>

<p>The present capital of the island is built upon the site of
the principal Dutch factory of former times, and is called
Ty-wan-foo; it is upon the west coast, some distance down
towards its southern end. The harbour has, however, become
almost inaccessible, except to vessels of very light draught of
water, owing to the accumulation of sand, which is thought
to frequently change its place. Indeed, the sea has gradually
continued to retire from many parts of the coast, and harbours
which were once frequented are at present inaccessible.</p>

<p>From the time of the expulsion of the Dutch, to the period
of our operations upon the coast of China, little seems to
have been known or heard of Formosa; and, owing to the
jealousy of the Chinese, and other causes, no attempt seems
to have been made to explore the island. The colonists are
described as being generally very turbulent and given to violence,
as it has become a place of refuge for all the bad
characters who can manage to escape from the mainland; but
it is also the home of many respectable and enterprising
settlers; although, being removed from the control of the
superior officers of the province, they live with less restraint,
and therefore readily become bold and lawless. For the same
reason, the local mandarins are cruel, rapacious, and ignorant;
and their behaviour towards our unfortunate countrymen will
suffice to stamp them with the character of treachery and
thorough baseness. But the cultivation and prosperity of the
island have increased in a rapid and remarkable manner; and
it is evident that British manufactures will soon be spread
among its numerous population, through their intimate connexion
with Amoy.</p>

<p>Besides furnishing immense supplies of rice, Formosa also
produces great quantities of sugar, camphor, and tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
which are exported to Amoy. A great part of the camphor is
already carried down to Singapore in the trading junks from
Amoy, but probably our own trading vessels will henceforth
procure supplies of it on the spot, in exchange for cotton and
other manufactured articles.</p>

<p>Unruly as the people of Formosa are, the island is, nevertheless,
somewhat famous for its schools, which are said to be
in a flourishing condition. Mr. Gutzlaff states, that the rich
men of Fokien frequently send their sons over to obtain literary
degrees at Formosa; and the Dutch, at an early period,
took pains to spread Christianity among the inhabitants, who,
at that time, were comparatively few in number. A few books
on Christianity were translated by them into the Formosan
language, and they were very successful in making converts.
Since they abandoned the island, however, nearly all traces of
their early labours have disappeared.</p>

<p>The close connexion of Formosa with Amoy will probably
be the means of reviving amongst the inhabitants some of the
lost spirit of Christianity; for we cannot doubt that, in all
parts of China, the increase of missionary labour will keep
pace with the increase of commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>The wreck of the Nerbudda transport, on her way up to
join the expedition with camp-followers, in the month of September,
1841, soon after our forces left Amoy, and the loss of
the brig Ann, a trading vessel, on her way down to Macao,
from Chusan, in the month of March following, upon the
shores of Formosa, served to attract unusual attention towards
that island, and to put us in possession of some little information
respecting the interior.</p>

<p>The history and ultimate fate of our shipwrecked countrymen
is calculated to awaken the most painful interest. On
board the Nerbudda there were altogether two hundred and
seventy-four people; of whom, twenty-nine were Europeans,
two natives of Manilla, and two hundred and forty-three natives
of India. The captain and the rest of the Europeans, with
the two Manilla men, and only three Indians, got away in the
ship's boats immediately after she struck, and were providentially
picked up some days afterwards by a trading schooner,
called the Black Swan, on her way down to Hong-Kong. The
unfortunate Indians, to the number of two hundred and forty,
who were left upon the wreck, after remaining by her for five
days, managed to construct rafts, upon which they attempted
to reach the shore. Many of them, however, perished in the
surf, and others are supposed to have been murdered by the
Chinese plunderers. The exact number, therefore, who fell
into the hands of the Chinese authorities, and were imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and subjected to the greatest privations, cannot be ascertained;
but they were thought to amount, according to the best information
which could be obtained, to more than a hundred and
fifty.</p>

<p>On board the brig Ann there were in all fifty-seven souls;
of whom, fourteen were natives of Europe or America, four
Portuguese, five Chinamen, and thirty-four natives of India.
Out of all those who were taken prisoners, belonging to both
vessels, only nine ultimately escaped an untimely fate, and
were restored at the end of the war, according to the terms of
the treaty.</p>

<p>The following account of what befel the unfortunate sufferers
on board the Ann will apply, with little variation, to those
who were wrecked before them, in the Nerbudda. It is extracted
and condensed from a curious journal, kept by one of
the sufferers, a fine young man, who was a passenger on
board. It was found concealed in his cell, after his unfortunate
fate, and cannot but awaken feelings of deep commiseration
for all his companions in distress.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> It was written
upon common Chinese paper, with a piece of bamboo, and
the account was continued to within five or six days of the
time when the final tragedy is supposed to have taken place.
It was written day by day, as the various little occurrences
took place, and some of the observations casually made upon
the appearance of the island will be read with great interest;
but I have thought proper to omit the minutiæ and repetition
of abrupt and hasty notes, which would have been tedious and
of little benefit.</p>

<p>It will here be proper to mention, that prompt redress and
"<i>condign</i>" punishment upon the heads of those high officers,
whose false and pitiless misrepresentations occasioned the
final catastrophe, has since been demanded, in firm and dignified
terms, by her Majesty's plenipotentiary; and one of the
conditions insisted on was, "that the property of the high
authorities of the island, who were perfidiously concerned in
the affair, should be confiscated, and the amount paid over to
the officers of the British government, to be applied to the relief
and support of the families of the innocent men who suffered."</p>

<p>By the orders of the Emperor, a strict investigation has
been made into all the circumstances connected with the
dreadful event; and a report has been sent up to Pekin, by
the Viceroy of Fokien, condemnatory of the misrepresentation
and duplicity of the authorities of Formosa.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>The whole of the fifty-seven individuals who were on board
the Ann quitted the wreck at daylight; and, having marched
along the shore about two miles, they fell in with two junks,
lying wind-bound in a small river or creek. They hoped to
be able to put to sea, and stretch across to Amoy; but the
gale continued so violent that it prevented them from getting
out of the creek. They were not ill-treated by the Chinese
junkmen, but, as they were without food of any kind, and
exposed to a cold, cutting wind, it was soon evident that they
must surrender themselves to the Chinese authorities. Soldiers
soon gathered round them in crowds; and, as they had
very little ammunition, any attempt to defend themselves,
which might have caused the death of some of the soldiers, or
of the mob, would certainly have been followed by the massacre
of the whole party. In the afternoon, they all gave themselves
up, without having fired a single shot, and without
attempting to make any kind of resistance. They were immediately
stripped and marched away, exposed to the most
cutting wind and sleet, without any covering, their feet cut by
the sharp shells with which the beach was covered, and with
very little allowance of food. It is not surprising, therefore,
that two men soon died from fatigue and exposure, and several
others fell from sheer exhaustion, and were obliged to be
carried along in baskets; others were afterwards carried in
sedans, more for sake of security than from any feeling of
compassion for them. It was remarked, that during the
whole journey of thirteen or fourteen days, to the capital of
the island, the lascars or Indian sailors shewed a great deal of
bad and selfish behaviour towards each other. Each man of
the party had a ticket fastened round his neck, stating what
he was, and whence he was brought; being treated in this
respect like public criminals. For a great length of time their
food was only salt fish and greens, with sometimes rice. They
suffered all sorts of abuse and indignities in every town and
village through which they passed; but it is remarked, "that
the women (who did not appear to be at all secluded) did not
join in this, although they exhibited the usual curiosity of the
sex." They were observed throughout the whole journey to
be very plain, but they had a pretty fashion of dressing their
hair, by weaving natural flowers amongst it.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<p>After the first two or three days, they came to a considerable
walled town, where they were placed for the night in two cells,
<i>about eight feet by seven feet</i>, in which twenty-five unfortunate
beings were stowed, with nothing to lie upon, the weather
being intensely cold. Three guards were placed over them.
The rest of the party were taken by a different route, but they
all ultimately reached the capital. One large town they came
to was enclosed, as were some others, by a high, red brick
wall. It was situated in a large paddy swamp or valley,
interspersed here and there with small hamlets, around which
the bamboo plantations were growing in great beauty and
luxuriance, and of extraordinary height, many of them measuring
upwards of sixty feet. In some of the smaller towns
and villages, the so-called gates (for they all had them) were
constructed of bamboo. The country appeared well cultivated
in many parts, and <i>wheat</i> and sugar-cane were met
with; but other parts of the country were very barren, and
covered with large stones, such as are called "boulders," in
some parts of England. Generally, the men were made to
wear handcuffs, but they were not of great strength, for some
of the party managed to break them off; and they were then
carried along in chairs, under a strong guard of soldiers, but
were occasionally allowed to walk. Wherever they went, the
crowd and annoyance of the hosts of curious gazers, who frequently
insulted them, was so great that it was a relief to get
lodged in the common gaol, which was divided into several
cells, each cell having cages in it, made of wooden bars, just
like the dens of wild beasts. The cells were also provided
with a regular pair of stocks, in order to afford greater security,
if required. One of the cells was filled with Chinese
prisoners.</p>

<p>The great object of the mandarins now appeared to be,
to get some of the party to admit that the Ann was a man-of-war,
sent to look after the crew of the Nerbudda, who were
known to be still upon the island. With this view, two of the
men were mercilessly beaten, but without the desired effect.
So common and so public a practice did opium-smoking
appear to be, that even the soldiers who acted as an escort
carried their opium-pipes in their girdles. For the first
twelve days, the prisoners were never allowed to wash even
their faces, and at length they could only do it in a dirty pool
by the road side. For the last four days before they reached
the capital, called Ty-wan-foo, they were compelled to wear
leg-irons as well as handcuffs. Generally, they were allowed
to purchase their own food during the journey; for which
purpose a little money was given to them, at the rate of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
mace, or about fivepence, a day. But this was only after the
first few days.</p>

<p>It was remarked that wheel-carts were in common use in
the island, and tracks of them were seen in all directions.
On the mainland of China these are unknown, except in the
neighbourhood of Pekin; but, in the island of Hainan, to the
southward of Canton, they are very common, and similar in
construction to those in use upon Formosa. They are, however,
very clumsy and inconvenient; the wheels, which are
small, being composed of two semicircular pieces of solid
wood, joined together, with the axle <i>fixed</i> into the wheel
itself, so as to revolve <i>with</i> it, and not within it, but made to
turn round under the body of the cart. The roads or causeways
are generally broader than upon the mainland, and were
in many places shaded with bamboos on each side. Several
rivers were crossed near the capital, and the country was somewhat
improved in appearance.</p>

<p>About twenty miles from Ty-wan-foo they passed a night in
a large town, with walls built of chunam; at the entrance of
which were placed several very long guns, not mounted on
carriages, but fixed upon the ground, rather to indicate their
good intentions than their ability to perform them. Here
again they were lodged in the common gaol; and, on the following
morning, the Chinese servant who had been taken prisoner
with them had a chain put round his neck, in addition
to his leg-irons and handcuffs. The next night (the last
before they entered the capital) was spent at an inn by the
road-side, which was so crowded with travellers that scarcely
any food could be procured. The Chinese had regular fights
and scrambles for the little which was to be had, and their
appetites appeared by no means delicate; but, whether their
hunger was appeased or not, they were all prepared in the
evening to enjoy in good earnest the luxury of the opium-pipe,
soldiers and travellers all alike; nor did the two mandarins
who were present interfere in any manner to point out
its impropriety.</p>

<p>On the 24th March, (fourteenth day since the wreck,) they
were destined to make their wretched entrance into the capital.
At the distance of six or seven miles from it, they were met
by an officer and a few soldiers, by whom their names and
their numbers were called over, according to a list which the
officer held in his hand, and they were then separated into
smaller parties, and led by different routes into the city. As
they approached the gate, they, for the first time, caught a
glimpse of the sea, with a few junks at anchor at a distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
towards which they hopelessly strained their longing eyes.
The walls of the city appeared to be in a state of dilapidation,
except near the gateway, where they had been recently repaired
and whitewashed. The prisoners were now fairly within the
capital of Formosa, and were conducted to an open space,
planted thickly with trees, but broken up by rough watercourses,
over which there were several bridges of stone.
Thence they were led through back lanes, avoiding the
principal streets, to the house of a high mandarin, in front of
which they halted for a short time; and such was the pressure
of the crowd and the curiosity of the people, that the chairs in
which they had been brought were nearly pulled to pieces
before they were ordered to get out and enter the outer gateway
of the mandarin's house.</p>

<p>Here they were drawn up in line, to have the tickets round
their necks copied; but before the process could be half
finished, the pressure of the crowd became so great that the
mandarins were obliged to discontinue the task. A ludicrous
scene followed, which, for the moment, afforded amusement
even to the prisoners themselves. The enraged mandarins
charged the mob in great fury, and whipped them with their
<i>long tails</i>, which, having silk woven on to the ends, gave
some tolerable cuts to the people's faces. For a few minutes
our hapless prisoners were put for refuge into a small temple
which was close at hand; but even here the mob pressed so
hard upon them that the door was nearly smashed in; and,
as a last resource, they were marched off, with heavy irons on
their legs, which bruised them at every step, to a prison in
the courtyard of a superior mandarin's house, about one
hundred yards distant. Here their treatment was very bad;
for several successive days they were brought up before the
mandarin to answer an infinity of questions, many of them
very puerile, about the names, ages, and duties of every one
on board the Ann; also about geography and the possessions
of Great Britain, and where the poppy was grown; how money
was raised, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Chinese carpenter of the vessel acted
as interpreter; and, on one occasion, both he and the other
Chinaman were severely flogged with bamboos.</p>

<p>After some time, those who could draw were allowed to
sketch ships, carriages, and other things, which exceedingly
amused the Chinese, who were glad to purchase them; so that
by these means they were able to procure food and tobacco,
and thus to diminish in some degree their chances of being
carried off by starvation or sickness.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a week or two, fever broke out, and
they were then separated into smaller parties, and put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
different cells or prisons, some faring better, some worse,
according to the temper or caprice, or even roguery, of the
particular jailer who chanced to have charge of them. One of
these wretches seems to have been a perfect fiend of his class;
he kept one party of <i>ten</i> miserable human beings in a den so
small that not one of them could lie down at night. It will
scarcely be believed that they were made to exist for <i>two whole
months</i> in this horrid black hole, only <i>eleven feet six inches
long, by seven feet six inches wide</i>; grudging each other every
little inch of room, and longing even for the little bit of space
which the single insensible bucket, which was the only piece
of furniture, occupied in their den. Here were ten human
beings stowed away together, some sick, some sore, and all in
pain and misery. For some time they were not permitted to
come out of the den at all, but at last they were let out once
a day, and were allowed a very little water to wash themselves;
only two or three, however, could wash themselves on the
same day, so that the whole of them could only be able to
wash themselves once in three days. Of course, they were
dreadfully infected with vermin of every kind, and, as the
author of the journal expresses it, "A few weeks have sufficed
to bring me down from a strong hale man, to a wretched helpless
being, disgusted with myself."</p>

<p>Many attempts were made to get a note sent across to Amoy,
to give information of their situation; and the promise of one
hundred dollars on its safe delivery, and one hundred more
on bringing an answer back, (to be paid at Amoy,) sufficed to
induce a tolerable trusty Chinaman to undertake the task. We
shall see presently how far it succeeded. It has before been
stated that the several parties fared differently, according to
the humanity or rapacity of the particular jailer. Something
also depended upon the particular mandarin under whose
supervision they were placed, but it is noticed that the highest,
or red-button mandarin, was the best of all, and frequently
ordered some of the hardships they complained of to be
remedied, particularly as regarded the quality of the food.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is stated, that one of the jailers, who
was humane enough to allow his party of prisoners <i>to be
shaved</i>, was taken before a mandarin and punished with fifty
strokes of the bamboo; after which, no visitors were allowed
to see them at all, and the jailer became very sulky, except
when he was drunk, which he generally was, by the use of
opium, every evening. Sometimes they were taken out of
prison in order to draw for the mandarins, at others, to undergo
repeated examinations for their amusement. In the first
instance, however, the object invariably was, to betray them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
into an admission, however remote, that the vessel was really
a man-of-war. But it was quite evident that they knew perfectly
well that she was not so, and at length the red-button
mandarin put an end to this part of the business. From this
time, their questions were more of a general nature, but many
of them were exceedingly absurd. The mention of Sir Henry
Pottinger's name (for they appeared already to have heard of
him) invariably made them angry, and on one occasion they
inquired whether he was a <i>white</i> or a <i>black</i> man. They also
inquired a good deal about the Queen, her court, and ministers,
mode of life, &amp;c., and how many husbands she was
allowed to have; expressing great astonishment when they
learned that in Europe kings and queens, as well as private
individuals, had only one wife or husband; and then they proceeded
to enumerate the virtues of their own emperor, and to
plume themselves upon their own cleverness.</p>

<p>On one occasion, they asked whether America had not,
some time or other, been situated <i>in</i> England? whether a man
could <i>now</i> walk from London to America in a week? how
large London was, and how many outside (foreign) nations
are subject or tributary to England? Endless were their
curious questions, and on one occasion they exhibited an
officer's jacket, and a corporal's coat with the 55th button on
it, and particularly inquired the use of an epaulette, which
they held up, fancying it was intended to be worn on the
head.</p>

<p>During the first half of the month of May, it rained incessantly,
and they were very imperfectly protected from its
effects. In fact, the rain always beat through their roof, and
when it was heavy, or long continued, it flooded their den:
the least bit of dry plank, or a partially sheltered corner, was
matter of envy and contention; and, as may be supposed, they
not only suffered from bad food, confinement, vermin, and ill-health,
but were incessantly tormented with the most venomous
mosquitoes, producing inflammation and sores. In this condition
they were kept in the most harassing state of suspense;
one day being assured that they would be sent away in a
month; another, that they had no chance of liberty for six
months; and the very next, perhaps, that their heads would
soon be taken off.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the talent for drawing possessed by Mr. Gully
and Captain Denham, served to gain for them friends and
pacify enemies.</p>

<p>In this way, month after month continued to drag its slow
length along. At the end of about three months' close confinement,
a slight change for the better took place; they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
moved into rather better quarters, where they were only three
together, so that they had more room to breathe; they were
also allowed water to wash themselves, and a little money was
given to them. It was thought that this arose in consequence
of information received by the authorities that there was some
chance of an attack being made upon this island, by our forces
at Amoy, with a view to liberate the prisoners. It was now
ascertained, also, that the fisherman who had promised to carry
over the letter to Amoy, two months before, had succeeded in
his attempt, and an answer had been brought back by him,
which held out the prospect of speedy release. Another letter
was also sent off to Amoy; so that now at length their hopes
again revived. But sickness had already begun its work, and
their minds were so depressed that even the boldest, who
tried to bear up bravely to the last, recorded his feelings that
"One miserable day passed after another, with nothing to
help them to break in upon the wretchedness of their existence;
no exercise being permitted, and nothing, in fact, to
relieve the dreadful monotony of such prison life." And what
<i>was</i> the little improvement in their lot, which resulted from
their removal into other cells? "We now, (three of us,")
said he, "have five planks with a mat upon them to sleep on,
and glad we are to get into this new place, which is the Executioners
Den, and which, until we had ourselves cleaned it,
could never have been cleaned since it was built." On other
occasions it is noted, "we <i>scalded</i> our clothes this morning, to
kill the vermin."</p>

<p>It was thought that the day they were removed into this
new berth must have been the Emperor's birthday, or some
day of rejoicing, for they had at the same time a dinner of
roast pork, with sweet cakes, and each man received one mace,
or fivepence in money. But this was too good to last&mdash;a mere
freak of fortune! Generally speaking, their food was so bad,
that a great part of it was thrown away, and it was only by
quarrelling with the jailers, and threatening to complain to
the high mandarin, that they could succeed in procuring any
eatable food at all.</p>

<p>In the month of June, several shocks of an earthquake were
felt, followed by terrific storms of thunder and lightning.
It is due to the better class of mandarins to remark, that when
complaints were made to them, they procured some temporary
improvement for the prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, it was made known that honours and
rewards had been largely conferred upon the mandarins, for
having contrived to make so many prisoners. This was in
answer to their false accounts of the business to the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
in which they said that they had attacked and destroyed two
English men-of-war which came prying into the coast, and
had taken all the people prisoners, enumerating the number
of black, and <i>red</i>, and white barbarians, and the quantity of
barbarian guns.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, Mr. Gully, who had necessarily been
ailing for some time, became seriously ill with dysentery,
brought on in a great measure by eating large quantities of
mangoes. The Chinese recommended him two cures for it;
one was, to eat the skins of the mangoes <i>alone</i>; the other,
to eat opium. The former he found to have a good effect, at
least so far that his complaint improved under the treatment;
the latter he was able to purchase at a moderate price from
the visitors, who brought it on purpose for him; it was different
from the extract which is used for smoking, and apparently
much less powerful.</p>

<p>The same mandarin who had given them a treat upon the
Emperor's birthday all along shewed more interest in their
condition than any of the others; and one day, in the hope of
inducing him to give them some kind of indulgence, they told
him that it was the birthday of the Queen of England's eldest
child, and that they all entertained so strong a feeling of
"filial obedience" and affection towards their queen, that
they wished to celebrate the event. To their great surprise and
delight, the mandarin's heart was moved by this appeal,
and he gave each of them money; to some five mace, to others
three, (equal to about two shillings,) and then sent them a
good dinner, and made himself quite agreeable; and, of
course, all the inferior officers, including the jailers, took
their tone for the day from their superior. On another occasion,
the lascars were all brought up before the chief
mandarin, having had new clothes first given to them, and he
himself then presented each of them with a fan!</p>

<p>All these circumstances naturally tended to revive their
hopes, and little did they dream of the horrible catastrophe
which was soon to take place. Towards the end of July they
were informed, that in the course of half a moon more an
answer would be received from Pekin, containing the Emperor's
commands as to what was to be done with the prisoners; and
they were warned that, if his majesty ordered that they should
be decapitated, it would immediately be carried into effect.
From this it would seem that the authorities fully anticipated
that the representations which they had made would induce
the Emperor to issue such a cruel command; but the prisoners
themselves still retained sufficient hope to induce them to
disbelieve the probability of such a tragedy. With the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of Captain Denham (whose life was saved) and the
Chinese carpenter, it does not appear that any of them were
tortured; but the dreadful cries of some of the Chinese
prisoners could be distinctly heard; and two poor fellows
were seen passing by with their hands <i>blackened</i>, having been
condemned to have them chopped off.</p>

<p>One remark is worth recording&mdash;namely, that the mandarins,
from the highest to the lowest, as well as all their servants
and attendants, were in the constant habit of smoking opium.
Tobacco was also in general use, as elsewhere in China, and
was extensively cultivated on the island. There was also
noticed (what should have been mentioned before) a curious
vine-like plant, grown upon trellis-work, and frequently observed
to be carefully covered up with mats; what it was no
one knew, but more care and attention seemed to be bestowed
upon it than upon anything else which was seen upon the
island.</p>

<p>The final tragedy is believed to have taken place upon the
12th or 13th of August, and is too horrible to dwell upon.
They were beheaded with the sword.</p>

<p>It is difficult to account for their having reserved nine individuals
from the general massacre. Of these, six were
Europeans or Americans, and three natives of India. It is
supposed that they were retained in order to be sent to Pekin,
to be there cut in pieces. Fortunately, the treaty of peace
saved their lives, and they were at length conveyed to Amoy,
and there met with all the attention they so much needed
from their own countrymen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>On leaving the bay of Amoy, on the 5th of September, the
appointed places for the rendezvous of the fleet of men-of-war
and transports, in case of separation, were successively the
so-called Buffalo's Nose, at the entrance of the Chusan group;
Keeto Point, a promontory running out from the mainland
towards Chusan; and, lastly, the bay or harbour of Tinghai,
the capital of Chusan. The progress of the squadron was
slow for some days, owing to light winds and a heavy swell;
and the Nemesis, being very light in the water, and having,
moreover, a leak in her bottom, (after the accident at Amoy,)
was kept pretty close in shore, to avoid the swell outside, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
seldom entirely lost sight of the fleet. A considerable quantity
of floating wood was picked up alongshore, which was
very acceptable for fuel, of which she had only a very small
supply remaining on board.</p>

<p>On the 13th, eight days after leaving Amoy, the north-east
monsoon set in rather suddenly, and somewhat earlier than
usual, with heavy squalls and a thick fog, which caused the
unavoidable separation of the squadron. At the commencement
of this change of weather, the Nemesis lost her fore-top-mast
and top-gallant-mast, but continued her course
leisurely alongshore until the following day, when she came to
anchor under a small island at the mouth of the river Taitchou,
about thirty-five miles from Sheipoo, and between fifty and
sixty from the Buffalo's Nose.</p>

<p>On the 16th, Capt. Hall landed upon the island above
mentioned, under which he had taken shelter, with a party of
men, to look for wood, which was much needed for fuel, and
also for refreshments for the crew, and then took the opportunity
of ascending a high hill, to take a survey of the neighbouring
country. The haze cleared off sufficiently to enable
him to discover the entrance to an extensive harbour, which
proved to be that of Sheipoo, where there is a considerable
trading town. He thought that he could also make out something
like the appearance of batteries or field-works at the
entrance.</p>

<p>The Nemesis now stood in for the entrance of the harbour,
which was very narrow, but fortunately, she soon fell in with
a fishing-boat, in which were several fishermen busy about
their nets, one of whom was made to come on board and pilot
the vessel into the harbour; and he was promised ten dollars
for his services if he took her in without any accident; but, if
she touched ground, he was threatened to be immediately run
up to the yard-arm. The poor fellow had never even <i>seen</i> a
steamer or devil-ship before, and was not a little alarmed.
But he perfectly understood the conditions, and gradually
recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p>The tide swept so rapidly into the narrow entrance of the
harbour, that the Nemesis was fairly carried through the
passage before the two small field-works, which were intended
to protect it, could bring a single gun to bear upon the vessel;
but the Chinese were seen running down from their little
encampment above, to man the guns.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the harbour or basin, the town now came
into full view, with a large number of trading-junks of every
kind, moored in lines close to each other on one side of the
town; while on the other, or the left, as you looked towards it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
there was a small fort, which appeared to have been recently
repaired and strengthened, but, like most other Chinese forts,
was left almost unprotected in the rear.</p>

<p>Upon a rising ground behind the fort, a small body of troops,
about five or six hundred in number, were drawn up, so that
the Chinese were evidently prepared for defence. The Nemesis
immediately ran in towards the fort, and took up a flanking
position, anchoring by the stern between it and the town, so
as to bring her guns to bear with the greatest advantage, without
exposing herself to the direct fire of the fort. Shot, shell,
and canister, were now poured in, and the fort was soon
silenced. But the troops could now be seen descending from
the hill behind, and bringing heavy ginjals with them, mounted
on triangular stands, as if they intended to oppose a landing.
However, a few discharges of grape-shot threw them into great
disorder, killing many of them; Capt. Hall then landed, at
the head of all the men who could be spared from the ship,
accompanied by Mr. Gully, and took possession of the fort,
the Chinese flying before them; four guns, two brass and two
iron ones, were destroyed in the fort, the temporary sheds and
buildings were set on fire, and water was poured into the
magazine to destroy the powder.</p>

<p>The whole party having now returned on board, boats were
sent out, manned and armed, to search for fuel, and also to
attempt to capture three large war-junks, which had been seen
on the way up the harbour. All the trading-junks were left
unmolested; but wood for fuel was so much needed on board,
that several of the wood-junks were soon picked out, well filled
with the necessary article. The opportunity was extremely
fortunate, and in a short time, no less than seven boat-loads
of excellent wood were obtained, amounting in all to about
seventy tons. Much labour was required to bring off so large
a quantity, and to stow it away expeditiously; nevertheless,
during this operation, one of the war-junks was captured, (the
crew having deserted her,) and, as soon as she was towed
clear of the town and shipping, so as not to cause any unnecessary
damage, she was set on fire in the middle of the
harbour, and shortly blew up. Two guns, together with a
quantity of ginjals, matchlocks, swords, &amp;c., were destroyed in
her.</p>

<p>But the day's work was not finished yet. About two o'clock
the cutters were sent away, manned and armed, under Mr.
Galbraith, to destroy the other two war-junks which had been
seen in the morning. One of them blew up close in shore,
but the other was towed out into the middle of the harbour,
before she was set on fire. One was found to mount fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
guns, and contained a large quantity of powder, with numerous
warlike implements of various kinds.</p>

<p>The whole of this day's work was exceedingly interesting.
The hills which surrounded the harbour were covered with
people, who crowded out of the town, and from all the neighbouring
villages, to witness the exploits of the "devil-ship,"
the rapidity of whose movements, the precision of her fire,
and the volumes of smoke and steam which issued from her,
seemed to awaken feelings of awe and mute astonishment,
even more than fear. There they stood for hours, apparently
unconcerned spectators of passing events; and as they saw
the destruction of the war-junks, while the merchant-junks
remained uninjured, they appeared satisfied that no mischief
was threatened against the unarmed inhabitants so long as
they did not interfere. The neighbourhood of the town along
the shore was laid out in very neatly cultivated gardens, and
everything bore indications of a thriving and well-ordered
community.</p>

<p>The day was now far advanced, and it only remained to
capture the two forts or field-works upon the island, just
within the mouth of the harbour. A shot or two had previously
been fired at them in the course of the morning, but
it was now determined to take possession of them, and destroy
the works. On nearing them, a few shells and rockets were
discharged into them, and the boats then put off, manned and
armed, under Capt. Hall. The Chinese had only just abandoned
them. The two field-works were very near each other, and
were found to mount nine guns, which were spiked, their carriages
destroyed, and the tents of the soldiers were set on fire.</p>

<p>The poor Chinese fisherman who had acted as pilot was of
course liberated as soon as the harbour was cleared, and he
appeared no less astonished than overjoyed when the promised
ten dollars were counted out into his hands.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 18th, the Nemesis reached the
appointed rendezvous at Buffalo's Nose, and found the
Sesostris was the only vessel which had preceded her, the
rest of the fleet having been kept back by contrary winds and
hazy weather. When we remember what a large number of
hired transports and store-ships passed up and down along
the coast of China from this time to the close of the war,
many of which had frequently a great part of their crew sick,
we cannot but be surprised<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> that so few accidents happened.
The inaccuracy of the surveys of the coast which had been
then made; the wrong position on the charts of most of the
numerous islands which stand out as bulwarks at very uncertain
distances from the shore; the strength and unknown
irregularities of the currents, and the heavy squalls which
frequently burst suddenly over that part of China, rendered
the navigation precarious, and frequently caused the utmost
anxiety. Occasionally the captains found themselves inside
of islands when they believed that they were some distance
outside; and I well remember, on one occasion, making the
voyage up to Chusan in a fast-sailing brig-of-war, which just
weathered a long rocky island, called the Alligator, and at
noon discovered it to have been laid down upon the chart
full twenty miles wrong in its latitude&mdash;an error which can
scarcely be accounted for.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>
<p>The strength of the currents among the Chusan islands,
and the continued boisterous weather, made it difficult to
collect all the transports at the appointed rendezvous. The
admiral did not get up until the 21st; and the general being
on board a large transport which had been carried far down
to leeward, did not join until the evening of the 25th.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Nemesis had gone to join the
Phlegethon at Keeto Point, where the sad tale was learned of
one of the officers of the Lyra, (an opium vessel,) Mr. Wainwright,
and one of the crew having been enticed on shore,
under the pretence of selling them stock, and of their having
been then overpowered and cruelly murdered. This event
occurred very near the village where Captain Stead had been
murdered some months before. Lieutenant M'Cleverty soon
afterwards landed with his crew, accompanied by Lieutenant
Crawford and the commanders of the Lyra and Ann, and soon
put to flight a party of Chinese soldiers, burnt their barracks,
and then destroyed a great part of the village.</p>

<p>As soon as the Nemesis arrived, no time was lost in landing
to examine the adjacent country, which was very picturesque
and beautifully cultivated. But the recollection of the cruel
fate of the poor fellows who had been so recently captured,
and, as was believed, barbarously put to death there, with the
sight of the very spots where the sad occurrences took place,
awakened feelings of bitterness, and a wish for retaliation
which it was impossible to suppress. In a very short time,
everything that remained undestroyed was set on fire, including
various buildings, stacks of rice and grass, &amp;c.; and as
darkness set in, the whole valley appeared lighted up with
the blaze of the spreading fires.</p>

<p>At length all the transports were assembled, according to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
preconcerted arrangement, just off the little island called
"Just in the Way;" as it was the original plan laid down by
the general and the admiral to occupy Ningpo, after having
first captured the heights of Chinhae, which command the
entrance of the Tahea river, which leads up to Ningpo. Chusan
was to have been retaken afterwards. The boisterous state of
the weather, however, prevented the ships from approaching
near enough to Chinhae to carry out this part of the plan; and
it was therefore determined to make an immediate reconnoissance
of the harbour and defences of Chusan, or rather of its
capital town, Tinghai; this was accordingly carried into execution
on the following day, the 26th of September.</p>

<p>The admiral and general, together with the plenipotentiary
and suite, embarked early in the morning on board the
Phlegethon, the Nemesis being ordered to accompany them.
As they approached Chusan, the alarm was given by the
Chinese from numerous watch-towers, or rather signal stations
erected upon the hills, or upon the tops of the several islands
which lie in the immediate neighbourhood. Great changes
had evidently taken place since our forces left Chusan, a few
months before; and preparations of an extensive kind had
been rapidly made for the defence of the place. As the
steamers entered the principal harbour by its western side,
between the so-called Tea Island and Guard Island, the
Chinese opened a few guns at them, but at too great a distance
to do any damage; and as there was no wish to attack
them in a desultory manner, the steamers were ordered to
keep at a good distance, but to direct their movements so as
to get a complete view of all the Chinese positions.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the tides, in the different channels leading
into the harbour, is so great that large vessels sometimes become
perfectly unmanageable; and even powerful steamers
found it difficult to stem the current.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more striking or picturesque than the views
on every side, as you approach Chusan; you are here particularly
struck with the garden-like aspect of every spot of
ground you see. The country is hilly on all sides, but every
hill is cultivated with extreme care, up to its very summit.
It is divided into small ridges, or beds, in which various
productions are raised, side by side, giving the greatest possible
variety to the aspect of the country, and pointing out
the vast labour and perseverance with which the tillage must
be conducted. It is entirely spade husbandry, and ought
rather to be called horticulture.</p>

<p>In the low valleys, and little sheltered nooks, you trace villages
and farm-houses of neat appearance; and every bend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the coast, every little bit of low, swampy ground, is embanked
and recovered from the sea by long, thick, stone
walls, which are maintained with the utmost care. Behind
these, the ground is laid out in rice-fields, irrigated with
much ingenuity, and there is a general appearance of well-being
and industry, which indicates a thriving and contented
population. Generally speaking, the island of Chusan, with
some of the smaller ones adjacent to it, may be considered as
among the most picturesque and fertile spots in the north of
China, as far as it was visited by the expedition, and the
loss of this possession was deeply felt by the Emperor, of
which, as he said, "he read the account with fast falling
tears."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The great and rapidly completed preparations which were
found to have been made for the protection of the island prove
the importance with which it was regarded.</p>

<p>The city of Tinghai, the capital of Chusan, is a walled town,
of the third class, about two miles in circumference, having
four entrances, with double-arched gateways, situated at right
angles to each other, according to the usual Chinese practice.
The greater part of the town is surrounded by a wet ditch
or canal, which adds very much to the natural unhealthiness
caused by imperfect drainage, (owing to the lowness of its
situation,) and by the swampy rice-grounds, which occupy the
whole valley. Indeed, were it not protected by a raised bank
running along the face of the harbour, from which the city is
three-quarters of a mile distant, the whole of the valley in
which the town is situated would frequently be flooded.
It was upon this raised bank that the great line of sea
battery, presently to be described, had been recently erected.
A narrow causeway and a shallow canal connect the city with
a village, at which is the principal landing-place of the harbour,
situated at the foot of a steep, conical hill, which stands
about the centre of the whole sea-face of the valley or plain,
which may be about three miles broad. The latter is bounded
by steep hills on either side, which stretch down close to the
city, and command the western face of the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>The hill at the landing-place, which came to be known by
the name of Pagoda Hill, is a very striking object from every
point of the harbour. The appearance of a temple upon it,
and several small detached buildings, which had been recently
built as prisons for the English, whom the Chinese <i>intended</i>
to capture, and the steepness of its summit, gave it an appearance
of strength which it did not possess.</p>

<p>Directly opposite Pagoda Hill are two small islands, called
Trumball and Macclesfield Islands, which bound the harbour
on the eastern side, and upon the nearest of these a mortar-battery
was afterwards erected, for the purpose of shelling
Pagoda Hill.</p>

<p>To the southward the harbour is shut in by the highly cultivated
and considerable island called Tea Island; while on
its western side, at the extremity of the long sea-battery, lies
the small island called Guard Island, only separated by a very
narrow passage called the Devil's Gates, from the hills which
overlook the valley.</p>

<p>As the two steamers now entered the inner harbour by the
western passage, leaving Guard Island on the left, they immediately
came in sight of a long line of continuous works, constructed
of mud, along the top of the whole line of embankment
before described. It is strange that such a mode of
defence should have been adopted; for the flank of the battery
was completely commanded by the range of steep hills running
up to the very city itself. Upon the nearest hills, however, at
the end of the battery, the Chinese had formed a fortified
encampment, in which there appeared to be a large body of
troops; and in a hollow at the foot of it there was an unfinished
stone fort, intended to mount eight guns. But they
had placed their principal reliance upon the line of mud-batteries
fronting the harbour, and had run piles and stakes
along the water's edge, to prevent our troops from landing
from the boats, as if they imagined that a battery could only
be attacked in front, and partly perhaps to prevent the
washing away of the soil.</p>

<p>The works had been hastily and unscientifically constructed,
and consisted principally of heaps of mud, of a conical shape,
raised upon the embankment, with embrasures between them
for the guns. These intervals were so large, measuring generally
from ten to fifteen feet wide, that it would be impossible
for the men to stand to their guns, although the mounds of
earth between them were about twenty to twenty-five feet
broad. The line of battery extended far beyond the Pagoda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
or Joss House Hill to the eastward, but was not completed at
that end. There were altogether nearly two hundred and
seventy embrasures, but only about eighty guns mounted,
exclusive of those in a newly-built redoubt upon Pagoda Hill,
amounting to twelve or fifteen. Of these twenty-five were
afterwards found to be of brass and copper, and tolerably well
cast. Several improvements had been made by the Chinese
for the strengthening of Pagoda Hill, since our evacuation of
the place. They had retained the wall which we had formerly
carried round the top of it, with an arched gateway of stone
on the side looking inland towards the town. Other improvements
were in progress; so that, if the attack had been delayed
for some weeks longer, the Chinese would have completed
their defences, as well as their want of science would
permit. As it was, the authorities claimed for themselves
the honour of "having fought with heavy toil for six days and
nights," reckoning the commencement of their so-called
fighting from the day on which the steamers first approached
to reconnoitre. Our forbearance was magnified into a great
victory by them, for the moment at all events.</p>

<p>On the return of the steamers to the anchorage at Just in
the Way, with the rest of the fleet, orders were given for the
Nemesis to proceed on the following morning across to the
Ningpo river, to reconnoitre Chinhae, &amp;c. &amp;c., but the weather
proved so hazy and unsettled, that this purpose was deferred
for the present. On the following day, the 28th, the weather
still continued very squally, which prevented the fleet from
moving; and the admiral, therefore, gave orders that the
Nemesis should proceed again to Chusan, in company with
the Modeste and Columbine, (the whole under the command
of Captain Eyres, of the Modeste,) and they were directed to
destroy the unfinished battery already mentioned, at the foot
of the hills at the western extremity of the long line of works,
and if possible set fire to the encampment on the hill above,
or, at all events, disperse the Chinese troops. The object
was evidently to prepare for the landing of our force at that
point, in order to take the line of Chinese battery in reverse,
and then march upon the town by the hills. The
increasing severity of the weather obliged them all to come
to anchor before they reached Chusan.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning, the Nemesis was sent in alone
to reconnoitre, having Captain Eyres and Captain Clarke on
board, and she soon discovered that the entrenched camp on
the hill was stronger than had been supposed, and that the
troops were collected in great strength at that point. As the
steamer ran pretty close in shore, a smart but ineffective fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
from large ginjals was opened on her from the entrenched
camp; but the small stone fort below was quite silent, and,
indeed, appeared to be unarmed. Having fired a few shot
into the camp on the hill, in order to warn the Chinese of
what they had to expect, the Nemesis speedily returned, to
bring up the other two vessels; and these, as soon as they
had come to anchor as close in shore as their draught of water
would permit, immediately opened fire upon the entrenched
camp above, and also at the fort below, in order to ascertain
if it was occupied. As the Nemesis, however, could stand in
much closer than the other vessels, Captain Eyres and Captain
Clarke went on board her, and she was then carried within
excellent range by Captain Hall, and immediately poured in
shot, shell, rockets, and carcases, with such remarkable precision,
as to have been made the subject of special mention in
the admiral's despatch.</p>

<p>In a short time, the temporary buildings were demolished,
and a breach was made in the wall of the fortified encampment.
The proper moment for landing was now come; but
as the orders were positive not to come to close quarters with
the enemy, but merely to reconnoitre their position, and prevent
them from adding to their works of defence, no attempt
was made to carry the encampment. A small party of men
were landed, but merely with a view to ascertain, beyond a
doubt, that the small stone fort below was unarmed, and to
make a hasty reconnoissance of the line of sea-battery, nearly
a mile long, which connected this point with Pagoda Hill. A
large body of Chinese troops were now seen forming under
the brow of the hill in the rear, in order to make an attack
upon the reconnoitring party; but a few well-directed shot
from the steamer's guns immediately dispersed them.</p>

<p>The object of this little affair having been now fully accomplished,
the Nemesis hastened to rejoin the admiral, with
despatches from Captain Eyres. Sir William Parker was,
however, already on his way over to Chusan in the Wellesley,
and now, without loss of time, came on board the Nemesis,
accompanied by the general, and ordered her to carry them
once more across the harbour of Chusan. The Chinese again
opened a distant and useless fire upon her as she passed, both
in going and returning, as they had done on the former
occasion.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, several of the ships of war,
and some of the transports, reached the outer harbour of
Chusan, while the Blonde, Modeste, and Queen steamer, proceeded
to take up a position under the two islands which lie
opposite Pagoda Hill, and which were called Macclesfield (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Melville) and Trumball Islands. They were directed to cover
and assist a party of the Royal Artillery, under Captain
Knowles, in erecting a battery of one 68-pounder gun, and
two 24-pounder howitzers, upon the top of the ridge of the
former island, with a view to shell Pagoda Hill and its defences,
which were within range, but rather distant. The
Chinese continued firing very ineffectually during the whole
time, in the direction of these islands, but their shot always
fell short.</p>

<p>The battery was finished on the following day, with great
labour and skill. Every preparation for the attack being
completed on the 30th, the dawn of the 1st of October was
looked for with intense interest. At daylight, the Nemesis
again crossed and recrossed the inner harbour, for the purpose
of embarking some troops which were on board the Jupiter,
close to Trumball Island; they consisted of a portion of the
Madras Rifles and a number of camp-followers. The Nemesis
then proceeded to the transports in the outer harbour, to take
on board part of the 49th regiment, together with a detachment
of sappers and miners.</p>

<p>The Howitzer Battery, upon Melville Island, opened fire
just as she was crossing from the inner harbour; and it was
an interesting sight to watch the shells falling upon Pagoda
Hill. The first shell was thrown merely to try the range, and
fell rather short, but the second fell exactly within the fort,
close to the gate, and it therefore became evident that the
Chinese could not long hold out.</p>

<p>About the same time, the Queen steamer endeavoured to
tow the Blonde frigate into a good position against Pagoda
Hill and the adjacent defences, to aid the mortar battery; but
so great was the strength of the tide, which runs like a millrace
in that part of the harbour, that it was impossible to
move the Blonde into a good position, in spite of the utmost
exertions used. But shortly afterwards the Modeste and
Queen, drawing less water, were able to take up excellent
stations; the battery on Pagoda Hill was soon silenced, and
the troops were driven from their post.</p>

<p>While this was being effected at the eastern extremity of
the inner harbour, the original design of driving the Chinese
out of the long sea-battery, by turning their right flank at its
western extremity, and by taking possession of the hills above
them, upon which their encampment had been formed, was
gallantly and effectually carried into execution. The Chinese
troops at this time occupied the heights in force, although
they had been dispersed two days before; and kept up a continued
fire of ginjals and matchlocks, apparently more in defiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
than for any useful purpose, for they frequently advanced
to the brow of the hill, waving their flags, and daring their
enemy to attack them.</p>

<p>The Wellesley had been moved as close as possible to the
intended point of debarkation, just outside Guard Island; and
the Cruiser and Columbine had been placed within two hundred
yards of the beach, there being plenty of water almost close
in shore. By the fire of these vessels and of the Sesostris
steamer, the Chinese were so completely kept in check, that
they could not attempt any opposition to the landing of the
troops. The Phlegethon now came up with the 55th regiment
on board. The first division, with the gallant general at their
head, consisting of the Madras Artillery, with eight guns, under
Captain Anstruther, together with a party of sappers and the
18th and 55th regiments, with the Madras Rifles, were now
landed, but not without some delay and difficulty, owing to
the astonishing strength of the currents. The Nemesis was
also coming up to land the troops she had on board, when
she unfortunately grounded on a sand-bank, and was obliged
to cast off the numerous boats she had in tow, before she
could work herself off again, which caused considerable delay.
The 49th were therefore not landed so soon as had been
expected.</p>

<p>The firing of the steamers which covered the landing was
kept up with so much precision, that more than one of the
Chinese standard-bearers, who boldly advanced alone to the
crest of the hill, waving their flags, were cut in two by a
32-pounder shot, just as if they had been aimed at with a
rifle.</p>

<p>The two flank and the third companies of the 55th being
first on shore, received a smart fire from the Chinese, who, up
to this time, had kept themselves pretty well sheltered; and,
as the remainder of the regiment followed close after the
leading companies, and the 18th was not far behind, the
advance was instantly sounded, and the 55th pushed up
the hill, under the gallant Major Fawcett. The Chinese
waved to them to come on, and opened a smart fire as they
struggled up the steep hill, and knocked down several of the
men. It was an exciting spectacle to watch them ascending
the hill, while the ships continued firing until they reached
the summit; and even then the Chinese shewed no want of
courage; the spear and the bayonet frequently crossed each
other.</p>

<p>At length the Chinese were routed; and the hill, being now
in our possession, gave us the command of all the enemy's
positions, which, by this means, were fairly turned. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
encounter, the first Chinese colours were taken by Lieutenant
Butler, of the 55th.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the 18th and the artillery being landed,
and some of the light guns having been placed so as to
enfilade the long battery, the 18th pushed on gallantly, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Adams, to clear the line of sea-defences.
The facility with which the flank of the Chinese positions had
been turned did not seem, by any means, to discourage the
Chinese, who fought, as they retreated, with great <i>individual</i>
courage, several of the mandarins boldly advancing, sword in
hand, to the attack. The loss on their side, as they were
driven back along so narrow a line, (for there was a deep
paddy-field in the rear of the embankment upon which the
battery was constructed,) was necessarily great. The Chinese
commander-in-chief and several Tartar officers were here
killed. They were at length compelled to evacuate the whole
line of sea-battery, the grenadier company of the 18th leading
the way, in a spirited manner, under Captain Wigston.</p>

<p>Having cleared the whole of the works, the 18th soon made
their way up the Pagoda Hill without opposition, the Chinese
having been already compelled to evacuate it by the admirable
fire of the Royal Artillery, and of the Modeste and Queen on
that side. The 49th, who could not be landed until the hottest
part of the work was over, followed the 18th along the
battery, but on reaching a causeway or path about two-thirds
of the way across, which appeared to lead from the battery
towards the city, they turned off at that point, and hurried on
towards the south gate of the city, to which it led.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the 55th pushed on along the hills, covered
by the Rifles, which had now joined, to the heights overlooking
the city on the north-west; and Captain Anstruther, with
Captain Balfour and Lieutenant Foulis, with great exertion,
brought up the light field-guns of the Madras Artillery to the
summit of the heights, and opened their fire upon the walls,
on which several guns were mounted on that side. The
Madras Sappers had also brought scaling-ladders along the
rugged hills, and the Rifles were skilfully disposed along the
edge of a deep ravine between the hills and the city walls,
sheltered by the broken ground and by tombs, (for it was the
burial place of the city,) with the object of cutting off the
retreat of the Chinese by the northern gate.</p>

<p>While these operations were going on, the admiral, accompanied
by Sir Henry Pottinger, Captain Herbert, Captain
Maitland, and Mr. Morrison, the interpreter, went on board
the Nemesis, (which, after landing her troops, had come
round the point of Guard Island into the inner harbour,) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
were carried towards the Pagoda Hill, just as the 18th entered
the works at the top of it. The admiral and the rest of the
officers immediately landed, and ascended the hill, from the
top of which there is a splendid prospect of the whole plain
beyond, and of the city, and from which a good view could be
obtained of the operations against the latter.</p>

<p>The Nemesis was anchored as close in shore as possible;
and Captain Hall, having got up to the mast-head, was able
distinctly to see everything that was going on, and to direct
the fire of the steamer, so as to throw a few shells into the
city, about three-quarters of a mile distant. The other
steamers very shortly afterwards also joined her in the inner
harbour. The 55th could be seen climbing over the walls,
the Chinese firing, and retreating before them; and the
British flag at last proudly floated over the fallen city. Three
British cheers were given at this moment by soldiers and
sailors together.</p>

<p>The capital of Chusan, with all its new and extensive defences,
was now for the second time in our possession. The
Chinese troops fled into the interior of the island, principally
by the eastern gate; and if a detachment of our soldiers had
been sent along the banks of the canal which runs up into the
plain on that side, probably a great number of the Chinese
would have been cut off.</p>

<p>The loss of the Chinese was considerable, both in the battery
and on the hills. On our side, one officer (Ensign Duell)
and one rank and file of the 55th were killed, and nineteen
rank and file of the same regiment wounded, many of them
severely. Of the other troops engaged, eight rank and file
were wounded, of whom half dangerously or severely. Besides
the guns already enumerated, together with large ginjals, a
vast number of matchlocks were found in the city, with
upwards of five hundred tubs of powder, some bamboo rockets,
and about one hundred cases of leaden balls.</p>

<p>The day after the capture, measures were adopted by the
general to endeavour to prevent the escape of the Chinese
troops from the island, by the numerous little harbours or
creeks from which they could get away in boats to the mainland.
Three different detachments of our soldiers were sent
out by separate routes to scour the island, while the Nemesis
and other vessels were sent round to convey provisions, and
to blockade the landing-places or villages on the coast. But
not a soldier was seen in any direction; the facility of disguise
and concealment, and also of escape to the mainland, being
very great.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether these movements, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
tending to bring the native Chinese population into submission,
did not rather serve to keep alive or to increase their
natural feeling of dislike to the foreigner. In fact, the inhabitants
of the Chusan Islands are generally a hardy and
independent race of people, and up to the close of the war, it
never could be said that we really had possession of more than
the actual city within the walls of Tinghai and its suburbs on
the sea-shore. No one could move even to a distance of two or
three miles from the walls, without having a strong escort with
him, or running the risk of being kidnapped by the people.
Many private soldiers and camp-followers were in this manner
cut off; and at length orders were issued that none but the
Chinese should be permitted to pass through the northern
gate at all.</p>

employed in digging a small spot near the top of a hill, where, at first sight,
it appeared impossible for him to stand, much less to till the ground. I soon noticed
that he had a rope fastened round his middle, by which he let himself down from
the top, to any part of the precipice where a few square yards of ground gave him
encouragement to plant his vegetables. Situated as these spots are, at considerable
distances from each other, and considering the daily fatigue and danger of this man's
life, it affords an interesting example of Chinese industry, stimulated by necessity."<i>&mdash;See

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>A few days after the occupation of the capital of Chusan,
a regular military government was established by Sir Henry
Pottinger, protection being promised to the well-behaved inhabitants,
who were moreover informed that "several years
would probably elapse before the island would be restored to
the authority of the Emperor." Thus it was evidently contemplated,
even at that time, that the island should not be
restored to the Chinese, until long after the conclusion of
peace.</p>

<p>The principal alterations which had taken place at Tinghai,
since it was given up by the English seven months before,
were found to be merely the addition of the defensive works
already described, and, to a certain degree, increased cleanliness
within the city. The suburbs at the landing-place had
been in part pulled down, or altered to make way for the batteries,
while other parts had been abandoned, and were afterwards
pulled down by our own orders during the ensuing
winter, to give a better circulation of air, and more room for
the detachment quartered there. In other respects, the so-called
horrors of war fell extremely lightly upon the inhabitants;
indeed, they were in most instances benefited by our presence,
and by the circulation of money which we spent among them.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the capital of Chusan is at all
a fine town, or in any way to be compared with others upon
the mainland which we afterwards captured or visited. Even
the walls, though of small extent, enclose a larger space than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
is actually occupied by the town itself; and, indeed, with few
exceptions, this appears to be generally the case in China.
The streets are extremely narrow, being mere lanes; the shops
are very poor, and comparatively insignificant; and the houses
are all low, but some of them, including the courts within,
occupy a large space of ground.</p>

<p>There is one building, however, which attracts universal
attention, as being one of the finest specimens of its kind. It
is the principal temple of the city, dedicated to the worship of
Foo, or Budha. In many respects it is superior to the temple
at Hainan, opposite Canton, and is scarcely second to the
principal of the numerous temples which adorn the sacred
island of Pooto, about twenty miles from Chusan, which is
famous for the number and elegance of its places of superstitious
worship, and for the hosts of priests, or rather, monks,
which are attached to them. There is belonging to this beautiful
temple of Tinghai, standing in a detached half-ruined
building, and apparently never used, one of the most beautiful
bells met with in China. It is quite equal to the one which
was afterwards taken at Ningpo, and was subsequently sent to
Calcutta. It is of very large size, but somewhat different in
shape from our own, and is covered on the outside with
Chinese characters, beautifully formed. Its tone is clear and
deep; indeed, the Chinese appear to excel in the art of making
bell-metal. It was worthy of being removed and carried to
this country; not so much as a trophy, for such it could not
be called, but as an interesting specimen of Chinese workmanship,
and of the advanced state of some of their oldest arts and
inventions.</p>

<p>Some interest attaches to the island of Chusan, from the
fact of its having once been the site of an English factory. It
is about fifty miles in circumference, of an oblong shape, being
about twenty miles in length by ten in breadth. The principal
harbour of Tinghai is difficult of approach, owing to the
astonishing rapidity of the currents or tides, the rise and fall
of which varies from six to twelve feet; the passages are in
some parts narrow, with deep water.</p>

<p>Chusan and all the neighbouring islands are extremely
mountainous, but between the ridges of the hills are rich and
beautiful valleys, which are highly productive, being well supplied
with water. The industry and care with which the
Chinese embank the opening of every valley towards the sea
are remarkable; not a foot of ground is wasted; and every
little nook or bay which can be reclaimed from the sea is
cultivated with the most assiduous care. The beautiful cultivation
of the hill-sides has already been alluded to, so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
is not surprising that the island is capable of exporting a large
quantity of produce to the mainland. For general commercial
purposes, however, little advantage could have been derived
from the permanent retention of Chusan; the population of
the island is not large; and, with the port of Ningpo within
a few hours' sail, and open to our vessels, there could have
been no compensating benefit to make up for the expense of
a permanent settlement upon an island in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The East India Company's factory was built in 1700, not
far from the present landing-place in the suburbs of Tinghai,
but the exactions of the Chinese officers, the expense of the
establishment, and the little prospect of carrying on a successful
trade, compelled them to abandon it three or four
years afterwards. In short, the internal trade of the island
must always be insignificant; and vessels which frequent the
harbour depend almost entirely upon the visits of Chinese
merchants, who come over from the mainland to seek merchandize,
which they would much more gladly purchase when
brought to their own doors at Ningpo, by which means they
would save expense and trouble.</p>

<p>The importance of the temporary possession of Chusan is
certainly great, particularly as long as the arrangements for
the opening of the new ports are not entirely completed. But
its value, as a <i>political measure</i>, is much enhanced by the
moral effect it has had upon the government and the people
of China, who look upon the Chusan islands as among their
most valuable possessions, the loss of which was peculiarly
felt by the Emperor.</p>

<p>In the commencement, the principal inhabitants of the
interior shewed a great disinclination to have any dealings
with us, and the common people frequently proved themselves
decidedly hostile to us. The kidnapping of our soldiers will
be alluded to hereafter; but that was more frequently attempted
by men sent expressly over for the purpose, from the
mainland, than by the peasantry of the island itself. Gradually,
however, all classes improved in their tone and
bearing; and, during an excursion which I myself made, in
company with a missionary, at the close of the war, we found
the people commonly civil and obliging, and rarely disinclined
to hold intercourse with us. In several instances, we were
invited into the houses of respectable individuals, who invariably
turned the conversation upon mercantile matters.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that there can be an <i>unlimited</i> production
of tea in China; its cultivation is limited to almost
two districts, and it requires peculiar conditions of soil and of
climate to enable it to be cultivated to advantage. A great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
<i>sudden</i> increase in the demand for tea would lead to an enormous
increase in the adulteration of the article by all kinds of
spurious leaves; and nothing is more easy than to fabricate
a mixture which will resemble in all its external appearances
any <i>description</i> of tea which may be most in demand; and
this fabricated mixture can be added to the real tea, in greater
or lesser quantity, so as not easily to be detected, except by
very experienced persons. The tea-plant requires three years'
growth before it will produce leaves fit to be plucked for tea.
At Chusan, the plant appeared to grow wild, or nearly so,
upon some of the mountains, but of inferior quality, and only
fit for native use.</p>

<p>As the season for active measures, before the complete
setting in of winter, was already far advanced, little time was
to be lost in carrying into execution the proposed movement
upon Chinhae and Ningpo. The latter city, from its size and
situation, would afford excellent winter quarters for the main
body of our troops; and the moral effect upon the Chinese
government and people, of the continued occupation of so
important a place, and the interruption of their valuable
trade, could not fail to make an impression calculated to facilitate
our future negotiations.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the expected reinforcements would have
arrived, both from England and from India, and the next
campaign would be opened with vigour, and would suffice, it
was hoped, to conclude the war. Ningpo, which is a city of
the first class, and therefore called Foo, (Ningpo-Foo,) is the
chief city of a department, and the second city in the province
of Che-keang, of which the capital is Hang-Chow-Foo. The
population of the province, according to Chinese documents,
numbers upwards of 26,000,000 souls, or very nearly as much
as the whole of Great Britain and Ireland together.</p>

<p>The town of Ningpo is situated twelve miles up the Tahea,
or Ningpo river, at the mouth of which is the small town of
Chinhae, at the base of a high hill, which commands the
entrance of the river. The possession of Chinhae, therefore,
and its citadel, would give us complete command of the approach
to Ningpo; just as the capture of Chapoo (which
was effected in the subsequent campaign) would lay open the
road to Hang-Chow-Foo, the capital; and that of Woosung,
which was soon afterwards taken, would give us free access to
the valuable trading city of Shang-hae. It could not be
doubted that the interruption of trade, and the stoppage of
imperial revenues derived from it, would make far deeper
impression upon the cabinet of Pekin, than sweeping off
thousands and tens of thousands of the people, whose lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
are so quaintly said to be "very tenderly cherished in the
paternal bosom of the Emperor."</p>

<p>A small garrison only was to be left in possession of Chusan,
but the embarkation of the rest of our force was delayed for
some days, by the continuance of contrary winds. The exposed
situation of Chinhae also made it hazardous to approach
it with a fleet, until the weather should assume a more
settled appearance. At length, on the 8th of October, the
greater part of the transports were moved to the anchorage at
"Just in the Way," nearly half way across to the mouth of
the Ningpo river. At the same time, the General and the
Admiral, accompanied by Sir Henry Pottinger, who was never
absent when active operations were going on, proceeded in
the Nemesis and Phlegethon steamers to reconnoitre the
Chinese positions, and to form their plans for the intended
attack. Everything was now extremely favourable for this
purpose, considering the advanced season; and the Chinese
allowed the steamers to approach quite close, within short
range, without firing a shot.</p>

<p>The city of Chinhae lies at the foot of a hill, upon a tongue
of land, on the left bank of the river, or upon the northern
side of its entrance; and its castellated walls are not much
less than three miles in circumference, connected with a substantial
stone embankment which runs up the coast for a
distance of full three miles, for the protection of the land from
the encroachments of the sea. The chief strength of the
position, however, lies in the precipitous, rocky height, which,
rising abruptly from the sea, at the extremity of the peninsula,
and throwing out a rugged spur, completely commands the
entrance of the river. Upon its summit, which may be about
two hundred and fifty feet high, a sort of citadel had been
formed, having a large temple for its commanding point,
connected by loop-holed walls with various other buildings,
which had been put in a state of preparation for defence.</p>

<p>The outer wall had two iron-plated gates; but the only
direct communication between the citadel and the city was on
the west, or land side, where a steep but tolerably regular
causeway led to a barrier gate at the bottom of the hill,
whence it was continued by a wooden bridge over a gorge to
the gates of the city itself. In front of the other, or eastern
gate of the citadel, there was a newly-constructed battery,
formed partly of sand-bags, and partly of masonry, mounting,
altogether, twenty-one guns.</p>

<p>Adjoining the suburbs of the city, on the river side, there
were also two flanking batteries for the protection of the river,
mounting, respectively, twenty-two and nineteen guns; while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
on the opposite side of the isthmus, lying between the hill
and the city walls, there was a small battery of five guns
pointing towards the sea, with a row of piles driven into the
beach in front of it, in order to impede the landing of an
enemy. For further protection on that side, a number of
guns and a large quantity of ginjals were mounted upon the
city walls, principally fronting the sea. The information
obtained led the General to suppose that there were about
three thousand soldiers in the city and upon the works outside
of it, while about seven hundred garrisoned the citadel;
but the Chinese official returns were afterwards found, in
which the details were minutely given. The actual number
was about five hundred less than supposed. The Chinese
had by no means limited their defences to the northern side
of the river only. On the contrary, there was good reason to
believe that the great body of their troops and their strongest
positions were upon the other or southern side of the river,
where there was a range of steep hills, overlooking the citadel
hill and the city itself.</p>

<p>On this side there were several strong batteries facing the
entrance to the river, mounting altogether thirty-one guns,
while the line of heights above was strongly fortified, having
a chain of entrenched camps along the points most difficult of
approach, with several field redoubts, armed with guns and
ginjals; in short, neither expense nor labour had been spared
to defend, as far as Chinese ingenuity and art could avail, the
approach to the important city of Ningpo.</p>

<p>The river itself was strongly staked across just within the
entrance, the obstruction being commanded by the batteries.
A little lower down to the southward below the river, in a
small bay, there was a creek, with a good landing-place at the
foot of the hills, and the entrance to it was staked across in a
similar manner. The importance which the Chinese appeared
to attach to the defence of these positions rendered it the
more necessary that they should be reduced, in order to convince
them, by the hard lesson of experience, that the utmost
efforts of their skill and perseverance were unavailing against
the science and the courage of Europeans.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 9th of October, the squadron
and the transports (the best-sailing ones having been selected
for the purpose) were able to anchor off Chinhae, in the most
convenient positions for the intended operations, which were
to be carried into effect early on the following morning.</p>

<p>From the description above given, it will at once become
evident that our operations against the main body of the
Chinese troops, on the southern side of the river, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
undertaken by the land forces, under Sir Hugh Gough in
person, while those against the citadel and town of Chinhae,
and the works on the northern side of the river, would be entrusted
principally to the naval branch of the expedition,
under Sir William Parker. It was arranged that a body of
men should be ready to land on that side, composed of the
Seamen's Battalion and the Royal Marines, with a detachment
of the Royal and Madras Artillery, the whole under the command
of Captain Herbert, of the Blenheim.</p>

<p>The Wellesley, Blenheim, Blonde, and Modeste, were to
take up positions as close as possible in shore on that side,
but avoiding, if possible, the chance of taking the ground at
low water, with the object of shelling the Chinese out of the
citadel, and of preventing reinforcements from being sent up
to it, and also to open a landing-place for the seamen and
marines. They were also to drive the Chinese from the walls
of the city on that side, and cover the landing. The Cruiser,
Columbine, and Bentinck, were to be employed on the southern
side of the entrance of the river, taking up their positions so
as to cover the landing of the troops at the mouth of the creek
already mentioned. The Queen and Sesostris steamers were to
throw shells into the citadel, and into the batteries along the river,
or, according to circumstances, into the Chinese encampments
on the hills on the south side; while the two iron steamers,
Nemesis and Phlegethon, were to land the troops, and then
render assistance wherever their services might be most useful.</p>

<p>The movements of the troops will be best understood as we
proceed. At daylight, on the morning of the 10th of October,
the Nemesis took on board the whole of the centre column,
under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, consisting
of the 49th regiment, with a few of the Royal and Madras
Artillery, and some Madras Sappers, amounting altogether to
about four hundred and forty men, with forty shot-bearers, &amp;c.
There were also two 12-pounder howitzers, with two 9-pounder
field-guns. The Nemesis then took in tow the Cruiser, sixteen
guns, under Commander Giffard, who was to superintend
and to cover the landing, and immediately proceeded to the
point of debarkation, near the creek, on the flank of the
Chinese positions. The post of honour was this day given to
the 49th, in order that they might have an opportunity of
making up for their disappointment at Chusan, where they
were landed too late to take the active part in the day's work
which had been assigned to them. At the same time, the left
column, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Craigie,
of the 55th regiment (accompanied by the General himself
and staff), was carried in by the Phlegethon to a rocky point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
a little farther to the southward. There was a low flat and a
canal, with two bridges over it, on their right, whence they
could move round the hills to the rear of the position occupied
by the Chinese. This column was the strongest, and comprised
a wing of the 18th Royal Irish, five Companies of the
55th regiment, the Madras Rifle Company, with one company
of the Madras Artillery and some sappers; altogether 1040
men, with four light mountain howitzers, and two five and a
half-inch mortars, with upwards of one hundred shot-carriers
and followers.</p>

<p>The distance of the point of landing from the enemy's
position was not less than a couple of miles; and thence they
skirted along the hills, until they reached a commanding
point, from which a full view was obtained of the whole of the
positions. By this time, the centre column had formed without
opposition; but a small body of Chinese troops, who had
probably been placed in ambush, under cover of a low hill,
were now discovered, and instantly dispersed by a few shot
from the Nemesis.</p>

<p>The 49th now received orders to advance up the hill, which
they did in gallant style; and, after clearing several field-works,
their colours were soon displayed upon the principal
redoubt overlooking the batteries on the river side. In this
attack, Captain Reynolds and Lieutenant Browne, of the 49th,
particularly distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>No sooner had that regiment got into close action than the
18th and the Rifles, on their left, having with great difficulty
got across a narrow and obstructed bridge, over the lower
part of the canal (which might have been easily defended),
and the 55th having crossed another bridge higher up, suddenly
pressed round upon the Chinese right, and threw them
into the utmost consternation. Many acts of individual bravery
were witnessed on their part; some the result of real courage,
others of sheer desperation. But the poor Chinese were fairly
hemmed in by the 49th in front, and by the 55th and 18th,
with the Rifles, on their right and in their rear. This
man&oelig;uvre, as may be supposed, threw them into the utmost
confusion. Their river batteries, being also by these movements
taken in flank, were at once abandoned by their defenders,
and a few of the guns were actually turned against
the flying enemy the moment we took possession.</p>

<p>The havoc among the Chinese was inevitably great, for
very few of them could be induced to lay down their arms, in
spite of the exertions of the officers, aided by Mr. Thom, the
interpreter, to make them understand that their lives would
be spared. Hundreds of them, as a last resource, rushed
madly into the river, and, of course, a great many were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
drowned; it is even said that their own batteries on the <i>opposite
side</i> of the river killed a great many of them, either purposely
for running away, or by aiming at our soldiers, who
were driving the fugitives before them. Many committed
suicide, including several high officers; but some of them
escaped, after throwing away their arms and military clothing.
About five hundred men surrendered themselves prisoners;
and a few others, who had taken shelter among the rocks
along the river side, were subsequently picked up by the boats
of the Queen steamer.</p>

<p>While these important successes were being obtained on
the southern side of the river, no less active and effectual
operations were being carried on upon the opposite or
northern side, against the citadel and town of Chinhae. As
soon as the Nemesis had landed the centre column, she ran
up towards the flag-ship, the Wellesley, which had been towed
into an excellent position by the Sesostris, to shell the citadel,
but she settled quietly in the mud as the tide fell. The
Blenheim had likewise been towed into a good position by the
Sesostris, but the Blonde and Modeste were enabled to go in
under sail with a light breeze. The terrific fire of these powerful
ships was immediately opened upon the hill-fort with irresistible
effect. Their precision in throwing shells was particularly
remarked, and nothing could long resist their sustained fire.</p>

<p>On the Chinese side, the river batteries opened upon the
Nemesis and Phlegethon as they passed the river's mouth,
and upon every vessel upon which they could bear, as they
occasionally came within range&mdash;namely, the Queen, Cruiser,
&amp;c. The Nemesis, having passed beyond the flag-ship, ran
in as close as possible to the town, and dispersed a body of
Chinese, who were drawn up with their banners, &amp;c., on that
side, and also opened upon a small fort at the landing-place,
between the Citadel-hill and the town; but she was then
directed by the Admiral to proceed with orders to the Sesostris
and the Queen.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, (past eleven o'clock,) the boats were
ordered to land the right column, under Captain Herbert;
and it was about this time, also, that the 49th, on the south
side of the river, were seen to crown the hill, and carry the
Chinese entrenchment in that direction.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>
<p>So severe and well-directed had been the fire of the ships,
that the Chinese had been driven out of the temple upon the
top of the Citadel-hill, and could be seen rushing down
towards the city. The seamen and marines, having disembarked
upon the rugged rocks at the mouth of the river,
advanced to the assault with great rapidity up the hill, and
entered the citadel, the gate of which had been left open by
the Chinese, as they fled.</p>

<p>The Chinese still manned the walls of the city below, which
were about twenty feet high, and also the two batteries upon
the river side, before described. The marine and seamen
battalion, therefore, pushed on to attack the city, and escaladed
the walls in two places on the east side&mdash;the enemy making their
escape through the western gate which led into the open country.</p>

<p>By this time, the batteries on the south side of the river
were also in possession of our troops, who now turned the
guns upon the batteries on the city side of the river, near the
water's edge. Captain Herbert's column was accompanied by
the admiral in person, who was one of the foremost to mount
the walls.</p>

<p>Three explosions took place during the attack&mdash;two near
the top of the Citadel-hill, and one at a mandarin station
near the river-side. They were supposed to be mines, and
two of them were fired by our rockets. Several Chinese
suffered by the explosions.</p>

<p>The city of Chinhae, and the whole of the defences on both
sides of the river, so much relied on by the Chinese, were in
our possession by two o'clock; the Chinese troops were completely
dispersed and panic-struck, many of the high officers
being killed, and the whole people in the utmost consternation.</p>

<p>Captain Herbert retained possession of the town, with the
marines, during the remainder of the day; and in the evening,
Sir Hugh Gough crossed over from the opposite side with a
few of his troops, and joined Captain Herbert. The rest of
our men bivouacked for the night upon the hills they had so
bravely taken. The total number of guns which were found
in the different works were no less than one hundred and
fifty-seven pieces, of which sixty-seven were brass, many
being very well cast, and of great weight. In the city was
also discovered a cannon foundry, with every preparation for
the casting of a great number of guns, including a large
quantity of metal. There was likewise some <i>copper ore</i> found
in the town, and a tolerable addition to the prize fund was
thus secured.</p>

<p>The loss on our side was inconsiderable, amounting to three
men killed and sixteen wounded, including one officer, Lieu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>tenant
Montgomerie, of the 49th regiment, which bore the
principal brunt of the day. The loss of the Chinese is very
difficult to estimate. But it amounted to several hundred killed
and wounded, in the operations on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>Soon after the works were all in our possession, the
Nemesis was sent some way up the river to explore the navigation,
having cleared for herself a passage through the
stakes; and, on her return to the Wellesley, late in the day,
the admiral, accompanied by Sir Henry Pottinger, proceeded
in her to examine the river again.</p>

<p>If we may judge from the various memorials presented to
the Emperor, after the fall of Chinhae, and his Majesty's
replies to some of them, we must at once perceive how great
a sensation the loss of this important place had made upon
the people throughout the entire province. They were now
alarmed for the safety even of Hang-chow-foo, the capital
city. Nevertheless, the emperor, far from shewing any inclination
to yield, continued to urge on more strenuously than
ever the most extensive preparations for the defence of the
province.</p>

<p>Before the fighting at Chinhae commenced, Yu-keen delivered
his seals of office to a faithful officer, to be carried
back to the provincial capital; and when, at length, he saw
the day was lost, he coolly walked down to the river's bank,
and there, having performed the ceremony of the Kotow,
looking towards the imperial city, he threw himself into the
water. It was afterwards ascertained that about fourteen more
Chinese officers were either killed, or destroyed themselves.</p>

<p>The death of the imperial commissioner, Yu-keen, seems to
have awakened a feeling of compassion in the imperial bosom.
His Majesty called to mind the death of the commissioner's
grandfather, in the same manner, during the reign of Kien-lung,
and directed that his departed servant, "who gave his
life for his country," should receive funeral honours of a high
class, in the same temple of "faithful ministers" in which his
ancestor had already found a place. The local officers were
to pay every honour to his remains, in all the towns through
which his body might pass on its way to Pekin.</p>

<p>It is an error to suppose that the Chinese are altogether
averse to change any of their established practices, however
opposed the government may be, as a matter of <i>policy</i>, to every
kind of <i>innovation</i> in the usages of the people. In the strictly
mechanical arts, no people are more ready to adopt, or more
expert in applying any new methods which they can comprehend,
and which appear better adapted than their own, to
attain the desired object; but their <i>imitations</i> of things are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
notoriously ludicrous. At Chinhae, four newly-cast guns were
found, precisely after the model of some carronades which had
been recovered from the wreck of the Kite, and they were not
by any means bad specimens.</p>

<p>In the construction of their new gun-carriages, several
striking improvements had been copied from ours, and, in this
and other instances, it was thought that they must have employed
people to take sketches for them. The most remarkable
innovation, however, and one which points out their extreme
ingenuity, was the discovery of some machinery intended to
be applied to the propulsion of their junks, resembling paddle-wheels.
This curious invention has been alluded to in the
early part of the work, but the actual machinery used for the
purpose was now first discovered. There were two long shafts,
to which were to be attached the paddle-wheels, made of hard
wood, about twelve feet in diameter; there were also some
strong, wooden cog-wheels nearly finished, which were intended
to be worked by manual labour inside the vessel. They were
not yet fitted to the vessels; but the ingenuity of this first
attempt of the Chinese, so <i>far north</i> as Chinhae, where they
could only have seen our steamers during their occasional
visits to Chusan, when that island was before occupied by us,
cannot but be admired.</p>

<p>A walk round the ramparts of Chinhae, was sufficient to
give a good idea of Chinese towns in general, and of the construction
of their walls, which, in some parts, could not be less
than forty feet thick. Beyond the town, the long sea-wall was
a remarkably fine specimen of masonry, composed entirely of
large blocks of hewn granite, sloping upwards. The whole of
China, in fact, appears to present to view astonishing instances
of mixed civilization and barbarism, of advancement and of
stagnation, in all the relations of life. Civilization appears to
float upon the surface; you observe so much of social order
and sobriety, and hear so much of paternal care and filial
obedience, that you are half inclined to think they must
be a very moral, humane, and happy people. Again, you
witness such proofs of ingenuity, such striking results of
industry and of combination of labour, in their public works
and buildings, canals, embankments, &amp;c., that you are inclined
to believe their institutions must have something good in them
at bottom.</p>

<p>But, when you look a little deeper below the surface, you
are astonished at the many evidences of barbarism and cruelty
which militate against your first impressions. The use of
torture in the hands of government officers is less striking,
not only because it has been in use in Christian Europe within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the last half century, but also because the obligation of an
oath being unknown in China, as well as a future state of
reward or punishment, there is in some cases, no other mode
of extracting evidence, than this cruel, unjust, and much-abused
instrument of violence. It is more difficult, however,
to perceive why they should have exerted their ingenuity to
produce revolting cruelty in their modes of inflicting death.</p>

<p>The manner in which the unfortunate Capt. Stead and Mr.
Wainwright were put to death at Chinhae, as it was afterwards
discovered, (for they were only wounded and captured at
Keeto Point,) affords strong evidence of their cruel love for
human suffering. The burial-place of these persons was
pointed out outside the city wall, beyond a little moat which
skirted them. It seemed to be the common burial-place for
criminals after execution, and there was an archery-ground,
with a target near at hand, for the practice of their favourite
weapon. The bodies of our countrymen were found rolled up
in stout mats, such as are commonly used for covering their
floors. It was difficult to obtain from the Chinese, anything
like correct information as to the precise mode in which the
unfortunate sufferers were put to death; for, although both of
them were at last beheaded, there is too much reason to believe
that they were first of all most barbarously tortured.</p>

<p>The infliction of the punishment of death in China, by any
mode which shall cause the mutilation of the body, is considered
much more severe and degrading, than death by
strangulation, or without the shedding of blood; and the
more the body is mutilated, the greater is the punishment
considered. The putting to death by "cutting in pieces," in
which horrible operation, decapitation is the climax, is,
perhaps, never at present carried into effect. It is reserved, I
believe, exclusively for rebellion and high treason. But the
Chinese seem to take pleasure in inventing various cruel modes
by which death <i>may be</i> inflicted, although, probably, they are
not now used, if, indeed, they ever were. The most original
and disgusting of all these methods, (of which, however, there
was no evidence of its being used,) was illustrated by the discovery,
either at Chinhae or at Ningpo, of the model of a
machine for <i>pounding women</i> to death. The original model was
found in a temple, together with various others of a very extraordinary
kind. It was very small, and represented a large,
oblong, stone vase, in which the woman was to be placed, with
the back of her head resting upon one extremity, (the long
hair hanging over the side, and fastened to it,) while her legs
were to be secured to the other extremity. The horrible
pounding process was to be effected by means of a huge stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
pestle, large at the base and conical at the apex, similar to
those which they use for pounding rice. The pestle, or cone,
was fixed to the extremity of a long pole, the pole itself being
fastened by a pin in the centre to an upright support, something
in the manner of a pump-handle. The extremity of
the handle being depressed by a man's weight, of course
raised the cone, and, the pressure being removed, the heavy
cone or pestle descended by its own weight, which was quite
sufficient to pound one to pieces.</p>

<p>It was stated that at Chusan a stone tablet was found, upon
which were carved the Emperor's orders, that every barbarian
who fell into the hands of the authorities, should be executed
by a slow and ignominious death. We know, however, that,
except in the case of the prisoners upon the island of Formosa,
this horrible threat was, in only rare instances, carried into
execution. On the contrary, the English prisoners were
sometimes tolerably well treated. This undoubtedly arose
from the forbearance which was shewn on our part towards
the Chinese themselves, and the humanity and kindness which
their wounded and their prisoners invariably received from our
officers and men, and which it was invariably the object of
Sir Hugh Gough to promote and encourage.</p>

<p>The scenery at the mouth of the Ningpo river is very
striking. High conical-shaped hills stand on either side;
and, as the river makes a bend a short distance up, the fine
mountains beyond come into full view, and add to the picturesque
beauty of the spot.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October, (the second day after the capture
of Chinhae,) the admiral proceeded up the river in the Nemesis,
in order to reconnoitre the city of Ningpo, and to
ascertain the practicability of taking the larger steamers and
the sloops up the river. In all respects, the river much exceeded
the expectations formed of it. It was found to be wide
and easily navigable up to the city, with not less than fourteen
feet water close under the city walls. It was also ascertained
that no preparations had been made for defence, as the positions
which the Chinese had taken up at the entrance of the
river had been considered by them as quite strong enough to
prevent the approach of an enemy. The people were seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
harrying out of the city gates, in every direction, in the
greatest consternation. The authorities had all fled, and the
city appeared to be in complete disorder.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost. With the exception of the necessary
garrison left at Chinhae, consisting of the 55th regiment,
(excepting the light company,) with one hundred Royal
Marines, and a detachment of artillery and sappers, the whole
under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Craigie, the rest
of the force was embarked principally on board the Nemesis
and Phlegethon on the following morning, the 13th, and proceeded
up the river, in company with the Queen and Sesostris
steamers, together with the Modeste, Cruiser, Columbine, and
Bentinck. The Blonde was left for the protection of Chinhae,
as a support to the garrison.</p>

<p>In consequence of unavoidable delays, the force did not
reach the city of Ningpo until past two, P.M.; but, fortunately,
there was no difficulty in landing the troops with the utmost
expedition. Across the river, just abreast of the town, there
was a well-constructed bridge of boats, which served to connect
the city, at the entrance of one of its gates, with the suburbs
which were on the opposite side. There was quite water enough
for the steamers to run close up to it; and, as the Chinese
shewed no intention of opposing the landing, the bridge was
immediately taken possession of, while thousands of the inhabitants
thronged the banks of the river, as mere spectators,
moved by curiosity rather than by fear. Indeed, the Chinese
themselves voluntarily assisted to remove the obstructions
which were piled up behind the city gates; and about three
o'clock the whole of the little force, amounting to no more
than seven hundred and fifty bayonets, besides the artillery and
sappers, were drawn up along the ramparts of the important
and wealthy city of Ningpo; and the stirring sound of our
national "God save the Queen" was played by the band of
the 18th Royal Irish.</p>

<p>The utmost quiet was preserved, and the Chinese were made
to understand that, deserted by their own authorities, and left
without means of protecting themselves, they might be assured
of protection through the generosity of British soldiers. Never
indeed was there a more peaceable victory.</p>

<p>The capture of Chinhae and Ningpo, so soon after the loss
of Chusan, seems to have inflicted so severe a blow upon the
Chinese, as to have alarmed the whole province, and spread
consternation even as far as the capital itself. Reports were
soon brought from every quarter that the inhabitants even of
Hang-chow-foo, famed for its luxury and refinement throughout
China, were moving away from it in large numbers, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
places nearer to the scene of action were already almost
abandoned. In fact, it was admitted that a panic prevailed
on every side; and it was feared that "treacherous natives
would seize the opportunity to rob and plunder, and would
form themselves into organized bands for the purpose of
creating internal disorders." There was also great apprehension
that our forces might proceed to capture Chapoo, one of
their most valuable ports, having the exclusive right of trade
with Japan, and situated in the vicinity of Hang-chow-foo.</p>

<p>It could not be doubted, therefore, that had the General
possessed a sufficient force to have been able to leave a garrison
at Ningpo, and <i>at once</i> to take possession of Chapoo,
which is, in fact, the seaport of Hang-chow-foo, and only
twenty miles distant from it, he might have marched to the
provincial capital while the Chinese were unprepared to offer
any serious opposition; and it is not improbable that the war
might have been brought to a termination in that campaign.
With the very small force, however, which Sir Hugh Gough
had at his disposal, such a movement was manifestly impossible.
The whole force which he could muster at Ningpo
amounted to no more than seven hundred and fifty bayonets;
and, as the city was not less than five miles in circumference,
containing a dense population, it evidently required a considerable
garrison to occupy the place, and to afford security
to the peaceable and well-disposed inhabitants. It was therefore
resolved to make Ningpo the head-quarters for the winter,
and to wait for reinforcements from England and from India
before opening the next campaign.</p>

<p>The province of Che-keang, which was now the seat of our
operation, is intersected by large rivers, and is traversed by the
great Imperial Canal, which, taking its commencement from
the city of Hang-chow-foo, and passing through the most
fertile and densely-populated provinces, crossing in its course
the two great rivers, the Yangtze Keang and the Yellow River,
runs northward nearly as far as the imperial capital, which is
dependent upon it not only for its wealth, but even for its
means of daily subsistence. A blow inflicted upon its immense
traffic at one extremity must necessarily vibrate along its
whole course, and be painfully felt at the other end; and the
great internal trade of China, through all its endless ramifications,
upon which perhaps the bulk of the population depend
for their subsistence, must suffer a universal and dangerous
derangement. What was of quite as much importance, also,
the imperial revenues would, in a great measure, cease to flow
into the imperial treasury.</p>

<p>The city of Ningpo, therefore, the largest in the province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
next to Hang-chow-foo, wealthy from its great trade, easily
accessible by water, and formerly the site of an English factory,
was admirably adapted for winter quarters. The troops
were placed, in the first instance, in two large public buildings,
and the greatest forbearance was exercised towards the persons
and property of the inhabitants. Proclamations were likewise
issued, calling upon the people to return to their ordinary
avocations without fear of molestation; and some of the principal
inhabitants were requested to assemble, in order that it
might be explained to them that it was the wish of our high
officers to afford them all possible protection, and to restore
order to the city; that the hostility of the English was to be
directed against the government, and not against the people.</p>

<p>All this sounded well at first, and was received with great
thankfulness by the Chinese, who seemed very well disposed
to be taken under British protection. But the announcement
which was afterwards made to them, that they were to pay a
heavy sum as ransom for the city, and as an <i>equivalent</i> for the
value of our "protection," was received with very great disfavour
and reluctance. Very little of the sum demanded was
ever forthcoming; and the substitution of a tax, or contribution,
of ten per cent upon the estimated value of the property,
was the cause of much subsequent ill-will, and some injustice.
In fact, notwithstanding the promises and hopes which were
held out, a very small portion of it was ever collected, and it
was at all times a subject of much bitterness to the people.</p>

<p>A tax of ten per cent upon the value of the cargoes of all
vessels passing up the river, which was afterwards enforced,
was much more successful; in fact, it was little else than the
collection of the imperial revenues, which the Chinese were
always liable to pay. It was, however, in a great degree evaded,
by an increase of smuggling along the coast, which the disorganized
state of the local government of the province greatly
favoured.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the collecting of any considerable body
of troops together in any particular province or locality in
China, so far from strengthening the hands of the authorities,
is more likely to occasion disturbance among the inhabitants.
Their raw, ill-disciplined levies are under little restraint, and
repeated complaints are always made against the lawlessness
of the troops. Little confidence being placed in their regular
soldiers, who had been so recently defeated, the people were
now called upon by the authorities to collect their brave men
from all the villages and hamlets along the coast, and to
organize them into bands, for mutual "defence against the
proud rebels;" but, in most instances, these bodies of uncontrolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
patriots became a scourge to their own neighbourhood,
and perfectly useless for any purpose of defence against the
enemy.</p>

<p>Ningpo is situated upon the extremity of a tongue of land
at the point of junction of two rivers, or two branches of the
same river, which unite just below the town, and form the
Tahea, or Ningpo river. Both of these branches are extremely
tortuous, and have numerous villages along their banks,
which are in some parts picturesque and well cultivated. One
of them leads up, in a north-easterly direction, to the district
town of Yuyow, whence there is a canal, supposed to lead to
Hang-Chow-foo: the distance is about forty miles; and nearly
halfway up this branch, situated about four miles from the
river's bank, is the town of Tsekee. Both of these towns shortly
became, as we shall see, the scene of our operations, our object
being to disperse the Chinese forces, which were being collected
at various points for a threatened attack upon us at Ningpo.
The other, or south-western branch of the Ningpo river, leads
up, at the distance of about thirty miles, to the town of
Fungway, which we also designed to attack, if necessary.</p>

<p>At Ningpo itself, one of the most interesting objects is the
bridge of boats, connecting the town with the suburbs. It is
apparently well contrived to answer the purpose for which it
is intended. The boats are all connected together by two
chains running across, and resting upon them, extending from
one side of the river to the other. This serves to keep the
boats in their places, without their being moored, and a
regular bridge of planks is carried from one to the other,
but only destined for foot-passengers, as carts for draught are
unknown.</p>

<div class="caption">BRIDGE OF BOATS AT NINGPO.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after the place was taken, the Nemesis and
Phlegethon proceeded up the north-western branch towards
Yuyow, the Admiral and suite being on board the former, and
Sir Henry Pottinger and suite on board the latter. They also
took in tow the Wellesley's launch and pinnace, manned and
armed. The object was simply to explore that branch of the
river, and to ascertain whether any Chinese were being collected
in that direction. Nothing could be more picturesque
than the scenery the whole way up, the tortuous bendings of
the river bringing a constant succession of new objects into
view, relieved by fine mountain scenery in the rear. Numerous
villages lay scattered upon its banks, but there was no appearance
of any preparations for defence. The inhabitants
generally, so far from running away with fear, crowded the
banks with looks of the utmost astonishment. The scenery
continued to increase in interest as they ascended, and particularly
at a place called Poonpoo, where there was a cluster of
extremely pretty country houses, or villas, said to belong to
several of the high officers of government. On every side the
country appeared to be in the highest state of cultivation.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of the way up, the river became considerably
narrower, and the turnings were sometimes so sharp
and sudden, that it was not without some difficulty the long,
sharp Nemesis could be guided round them. At length, about
five o'clock, they reached the city of Yuyow, and came to
anchor close under its walls, in about three fathoms water.</p>

<p>The Admiral, accompanied by the numerous officers who
had attended him, including Captains Maitland, Herbert, Blake,
and others, now got into the boats from the Nemesis, as did
also Sir Henry Pottinger, and his suite from the Phlegethon,
and proceeded up the river above the town, to reconnoitre.
They passed under a well-constructed stone bridge of three
arches, the centre one being about thirty feet high; but the
day was already far advanced, and the rain began to fall
heavily. Nothing of a hostile character was observed in the
neighbourhood, and they all very gladly returned without
landing, but did not reach the steamers until they were completely
drenched.</p>

<p>Sir William Parker did not escape suffering from the exposure
he had undergone, and was laid up almost immediately
afterwards with an attack of rheumatism; indeed, it was often
a matter of surprise that he escaped with so little illness during
his anxious and indefatigable services, in which he never
spared himself on any occasion, or shrunk from any exposure.</p>

<p>In the city of Ningpo, things gradually began to settle down
into their regular course; the Chinese soon opened their shops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and were very glad to sell their wares at an exorbitant price.
Provisions, also, were brought in plentifully, and there was every
probability that the winter would be passed in tolerable tranquillity.
Some of the principal people are said to have come
forward, and expressed their willingness to be taken <i>permanently</i>
under British rule, under a guarantee of protection,
but their professions were little relied on.</p>

<p>Some of the temples at Ningpo are very handsome, and one
of them in particular is well worth seeing. They fortunately
escaped the plundering of the Chinese thieves. Not so, however,
the private houses, particularly in the suburbs, which were
less under our control, and were almost as extensive as the
town. In these, one whole street was discovered entirely at
the mercy of the mob, who had carried off nearly everything
that could be moved, in almost every house. Several of these
rogues were caught in the act, and were handed over to the
tender mercies of the people themselves. Several of them, also,
were well flogged, and others had their tails cut off, by the
general's orders.</p>

<p>One of the buildings which attracted most interest was the
town prison, in which Captain Anstruther and others of our
unfortunate countrymen had been so long confined. The
identical cages in which they had been shut up were found still
there, and others of a similar kind, ready for the reception of
any of the barbarians who might fall into their hands. The
way in which Captain Anstruther managed to find out his old
prison was rather curious. He is said to have had himself
blindfolded, and then carefully numbered the steps he had formerly
taken, and the different turnings he had made; and
by these means contrived, within a few yards, to hit the very
spot.</p>

<p>A party arrived there in time to get possession of some
Sycee silver which had not yet been removed from the offices;
but it is supposed that much more had already been carried
away by plunderers. A very large quantity of the base coin
called <i>cash</i>, the <i>only</i> coined money of China, was found in
another part of the town; and the enormous stores of grain,
belonging to government, were also taken possession of, and
afterwards sold to the people at a cheap rate. This produced
a considerable addition to the prize fund, but the policy of
selling it at so low a rate was somewhat questioned. Every
man was allowed to go into the stores, at which a strong
guard was placed, and fill as large a sack as he could carry
out of it for <i>one dollar</i>, its actual value being about <i>four</i>.
But only a small portion of this was actually obtained by the
<i>poor</i> people; for it was asserted, at least by the Chinese, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the <i>farmers themselves</i> managed to get a considerable share of
it by means of their servants, so that they might be able
to continue to keep up the price by a species of monopoly.
It was also feared that, in case of a failure of the crops,
a serious famine might happen to the people, owing to the
want of the accustomed stores which are usually laid up by
the government, in the paternal spirit of providing the poor
with food at a moderate price, in the event of such a contingency.
The sum added to the prize-fund by the sale of these
stores of grain, of which there was said to be two years'
supply, was considerable. There were also large stores of
sugar discovered in the town.</p>

<p>Amongst other unexpected prizes, not the least interesting
was that of a stud of Chinese horses, or ponies, small, but
hardy little things, used exclusively for saddle, and generally
employed only by the higher mandarins. Upwards of forty
of these ponies were selected, and trained for the artillery,
and amusing enough it was to see the commencement of their
apprenticeship. One of the great disadvantages the General
laboured under, on many occasions, was the want of horses
for his staff; the necessity of carrying his orders on foot not
only caused delay, but rendered the duty very harassing,
particularly during some of the hot, sultry days in the earlier
part of this campaign.</p>

<p>The Chinese horses are extremely small, literally ponies,
but strong, and of good bone and tolerable figure; but they
are not numerous, being considered rather as a valuable indication
of rank or wealth than as the common slave of man,
either for labour or amusement. The Chinese take no pains
to improve the breed, and very little care of them, as to their
food, grooming, &amp;c. In reality, a Chinaman is the most
awkward-looking horseman imaginable, and the walk or the
jog-trot is the only pace that either his inclination, <i>his dignity</i>,
or the slippery nature of his causeways, permit him to adopt.
Population in China is so dense, and consequently labour so
abundant, that they stand in very little need of the help of
the lower animals to assist the hand of man, and rather
grudge the food which is necessary for their maintenance.</p>

<p>The best way to obtain a good view of Ningpo and the
surrounding country is to ascend the pagoda, which forms one
of its most striking objects. It is one hundred and fifty-five feet
high, of an octagonal form, having windows all the way up,
with a lantern in each; so that, if lighted up, the effect would
be very striking. The lower part of it is built of stone, but
the upper part of brick. In other respects it differs but little
from other structures of the same description. It appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
be connected with a public burial-ground, as numerous graves
and monuments lie scattered round it. From the top of it
you get quite a panoramic view of the city and the river, with
its two tributaries or branches, the mountains in the distance,
and the fine, rich, alluvial, well-watered, and highly-cultivated
plain which extends down towards the sea-coast.</p>

<p>The town itself differs little in appearance from that of
Canton and most other towns in China, but it is considerably
smaller than the former; it has the same narrow streets,
crossed here and there by the heavy stone arches, or rather
tablets, which are frequently erected to do honour to some
great or popular man, the same curious, long, ornamented
sign-boards, on each side of the shops, and the same crowded
clusters of houses, of curious shape, and mostly of one story.</p>

<p>Many of the houses of the better class of people, not deserted
entirely by their owners, were visited by our officers, who
generally met with a very courteous reception. Indeed, the
Chinese well know how to make a virtue of necessity, and to
conciliate your good graces by the offer of tea, cakes, tobacco,
or flowers, rather than run the chance of exciting your ill-will,
or your less friendly visits, by an affectation of independence
or rude indifference. The Chinese of the respectable
classes are capable of being extremely courteous, are well-bred,
and even elegant in their manners; and the proper
mode of treating them is to insist on this kind of demeanour
as if it were due to you, and to accept it as your <i>right</i>. But
there are no people who <i>can</i> be more rude, overbearing, and
uncourteous than the Chinese, when they think that they can
withhold from you with impunity, or without notice, the
courtesies which are habitual among themselves.</p>

<p>Considering how much the property of the inhabitants of
Ningpo was at our mercy, it is creditable that so little injury
was done to it during the many months in which the city was
in our possession. But it is also deserving of remark that,
during the whole period of the war with the Chinese, no considerable
collection of Chinese curiosities or works of art,
many of which are extremely interesting and novel to us, was
made for public purposes. With the exception of a few specimens
of Chinese weapons and clothing, which were sent to
different public institutions by private individuals, no attempt
was made to form a sort of Chinese Museum.</p>

<p>It is also to be regretted that some one or more scientific
gentlemen were not attached to the expedition, who, with the
assistance of an interpreter, might have made us acquainted
with many interesting subjects of natural history, and of the
productions of the country. Where, for instance, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
immense quantity of Sycee silver, which is <i>annually</i> exported
from China, obtained? Where are their copper-mines, and
how are they worked? Coal mines also exist in several parts
of China; at Ningpo, coal was sold in small quantities, and at
Nankin immense supplies of excellent coal were found laid
up for the coming winter, and our steamers found it answer
very well. The mineral productions of China, of which there
are probably many, are almost entirely unknown to us.</p>

<p>The taste for European manufactures had reached Ningpo
long before we got possession of it. There were one or two
shops for the sale of what were called Canton wares, that is,
English goods brought up from Canton, and, of course, sold
enormously dear. In one of them was a quantity of English
glass of various kinds. English gilt buttons were found, and
were in demand for the dresses of the higher classes, particularly
of the women, who seemed to prefer those which had the
East India Company's crest, the lion, upon them. A large
quantity of cloth was also found imported from Russia, and
called Russian cloth; but, in reality, there is little doubt that
the cloth was manufactured in <i>England</i>, for <i>Russian merchants</i>,
expressly for their overland trade with China. It is a known
fact, that orders of this description, for cloth made expressly
of a particular kind, have long been executed in England.
This, then, ought <i>now</i> to become a direct trade in our own
hands.</p>

<p>The Chinese appear to excel in the art of wood-carving,
some very fine specimens of which were found in their houses.
One house in particular at Ningpo was distinguished by the
tasteful carving of its furniture, particularly of that which
belonged to the bed-rooms. Some of their wardrobes and
bedsteads were elegantly ornamented with carved work, inlaid
with various kinds of wood, and representing landscapes,
figures, &amp;c. Some of their specimens of fretwork, with silk at
the back, and of embroidered silk furniture, were extremely
elegant. Above all things, they excel in the art of <i>varnishing</i>
plain or carved wood, and they have also some method of
giving a fine gloss to painted work, which very much increases
its durability, although it is different from varnish.</p>

<p>One of their greatest deficiencies appears to be in the mode
of lighting their houses. Glass is so little used, and the
manufacture of it so imperfectly known among them, that
almost the only mode which they adopt of letting in the light,
and of excluding the air at the same time, is by lattice-work
windows, sometimes neatly carved, and lined inside with very
thin transparent paper. Occasionally, however, a single pane
of glass is found in the centre of the window, while in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
instances the whole of it is covered with the thin transparent
lining of oyster-shells, which admit a very imperfect light.
The artificial lighting of the best houses is often very well
effected by coloured lamps, several of which are suspended
from the ceiling, and painted with various designs, landscapes,
&amp;c. But the painting is <i>on</i>, not <i>in</i> the glass; the latter art
appears to be quite unknown to the Chinese.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it was not safe to wander far from the
gates of the town, except when a large party went together
upon a shooting excursion. Pheasants, and a sort of pigeon,
with woodcocks and teal, were generally found without difficulty;
but the Chinese seemed mightily astonished that any
one should take the trouble to <i>walk</i> over the country, mile
after mile, merely for the trouble of shooting birds. It is
curious that, expert and indefatigable as they are in catching
fish, they should be so indifferent to the art of catching or
killing birds, which are to be found in almost every part of
the country in great abundance; but they seem to be deterred
by the trouble of seeking for them, and have very little knowledge
of the relative value of the different species as articles of
diet. The lower class of people will gladly devour any kind
of bird you shoot for them. I have seen them glad to get
birds of prey even, and yet they take no pains to secure the
thousands of wild-fowl which are to be found upon the banks
of the same rivers in which they catch their fish.</p>

<p>That it was not safe to go out alone, even well armed, soon
became evident, for they made more than one attempt to carry
off a sentry on duty, and would have succeeded in their object,
had not the guard instantly come up on the alarm being
given. On these occasions, as may be supposed, a Chinaman
or two stood a chance of being shot. But the boldest of them
all were the professed thieves, who continued to commit depredations
upon their countrymen in the most barefaced
manner, in spite of the severe examples which were sometimes
made.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when a small foraging party was out
looking for poultry and bullocks, some Chinamen pointed out
a spot where they said a quantity of Sycee silver had been
concealed. This was too great a temptation for the soldiers
to resist; but the moment they had loaded themselves with
the silver the Chinese surrounded them, and they were obliged
to let fall the Sycee in order to defend themselves, and then
beat a retreat. A quarrel then arose of course among the
Chinese about the division of the spoil, of which <i>they</i> had not
robbed their countrymen, but had only captured it from the
barbarians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>So many attempts were made to entrap our soldiers and
sailors, and to carry them off, both at Ningpo and Chinhae,
that great caution was necessary, and, in spite of the many
warnings, some of their attempts were successful. They had
less inclination to molest the officers; not that they loved
them better, or desired them less as prisoners, but that they
had greater respect for the double-barrelled pistols which
many of the officers carried in their pockets, and which <i>all</i>
were supposed to be provided with.</p>

<p>An attempt was made more than once by the Chinese to
rob our commissariat stores, but it was frustrated by our vigilance.
But the Chinese are uncommonly expert house-breakers,
as many people in Hong-Kong can testify, where
houses and stores of the most substantial kind were broken
into in a very ingenious manner, generally by removing some
of the stones or bricks near the foundation.</p>

<p>The attempt to establish a Chinese police at Ningpo, and
also at Chusan, was tolerably successful; at least it was not
difficult to find men who were willing enough to <i>receive the
pay</i>, and wear the badge of a policeman; but it is not quite
so certain that they were equally ready to detect thieves, or to
protect the property of individuals. Sometimes, by way of
appearing to do something, they gave false information, which
served to create a stir for the moment. Upon the whole, they
were certainly of some use; but the want of knowledge of the
language, and the small number of interpreters, since Mr.
Gutzlaff had almost the sole management of them, rendered
their services less available than could have been wished.
They were occasionally useful as spies, and obtained information
of reports among their countrymen, concerning the plans
and intentions of the mandarins.</p>

<p>But, besides these, we had also regular spies in our pay,
one of whom, a Chinese who spoke English, and came to be
known by the name of Blundell, was sent up to Hang-chow-foo,
but was afraid to deliver the paper which was entrusted to
him, and returned without having accomplished his object.
He was supposed to be employed as a spy by both parties, the
Chinese as well as ourselves. Generally, pretty correct information
was obtained of the proposed movements of the
Chinese, the assembling of their troops, and the orders of the
imperial cabinet.</p>

<p>At Ningpo, and in its neighbourhood, there were no indications
of hostile preparations for some time after the place
was in our possession. It was not until quite the end of
November that reports, upon which reliance could be placed,
reached the general, that troops were collecting in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
neighbouring towns, particularly at Yuyow, the town which
had already been visited, and rumours were afloat of some
projected attack, on the part of the Chinese, upon Ningpo
itself. Plans now began to be laid for dispersing these different
bodies of troops, and for the purpose of instilling a
wholesome terror into the minds of the people; but active
measures did not take place until two or three weeks afterwards.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Nemesis was sent over to Chusan,
stopping a day or two at Chinhae on the way, to procure fuel,
and to overhaul a number of large junks which were at anchor
a few miles from the mouth of the river. They were found to
be laden principally with peas, rice, oil, walnuts, liquorice-root,
&amp;c.; and had they been met with a few months later,
they would all have been detained, as were hundreds of a
similar kind at Woosung; but at this time they were not
molested. <i>Opium was found in them all</i>, in small quantities
only, for the use of the people on board, but apparently not
for sale.</p>

<p>The weather was now clear and bracing, and the sickness
which had partially attacked our troops, on first taking possession
of the town, had almost entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>On the occasion of a visit to the opposite side of the river,
a singular circumstance occurred. Two Chinamen were seen
at some little distance, hastening along with a large round
basket carried between them, carefully covered up, but which
at first attracted little notice. Some of the party had the
curiosity to raise up the covering a little, when, to their great
surprise and amusement, a very young and pretty-looking
Chinese lady was found stowed in it, hoping, probably, by this
device to escape detection. The poor thing was almost
frightened to death; but she remained perfectly quiet until
she was covered up again, when the men were allowed to trot
away with her as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, a gay-looking sedan chair was seen
passing near a village, probably belonging to some of the
mandarins; but no sooner did the party run up to examine
it, than its occupier jumped out and ran away for his life.</p>

<p>But the most singular thing of this kind was finding a
Chinese lady stowed away in the locker of a boat, as if she
were dead. Orders had been issued by the admiral to examine
all junks leaving the city, in order to prevent them from
carrying away plunder. One of these had just been examined,
without finding anything of value on board, when it occurred
that something might still be concealed in the after-locker, a
sort of cupboard of moderate size. On opening this sanctum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
it appeared to contain what looked like the dead body of a
female, recently put into it, well dressed, and, judging from
her handsome shoes and small feet, a person of some importance.
This looked a very strange affair; but as no one
could speak a word of the language, it was impossible to
inquire into it. However, as it appeared to be a capital opportunity
to examine the nature of a Chinese lady's foot, the
men were ordered by Capt. Hall to lift the body out; and this
appeared likely to be no easy matter, so closely did it seem to
be jammed in. But the moment the Jacks laid hold of the
shoulders, a tremendous scream issued forth, as if a ghost had
suddenly been endowed with some unearthly voice. The
poor thing had only shammed being dead, in order, as she
thought, to escape detection. She was now very gently lifted
out, and not without some difficulty, being literally half dead
with the fright and confinement. In the bottom of the locker
beneath her was found a bag of money, with which she had
evidently attempted to escape. She was, of course, allowed
to go away without further molestation, boat and all.</p>

<p>The question of infanticide has been already alluded to in a
previous chapter. According to Barrow, it was considered
part of the duty of the police at Pekin to collect every morning,
in a cart sent round for the purpose, the dead bodies of
infants which were thrown into the streets during the night.
Sometimes they were found still alive, and these were commonly
rescued by the Roman-catholic missionaries, who
attended for the purpose, and subsequently brought them up
in the Roman-catholic faith. Mr. Gutzlaff also alludes to this
horrible practice, as being far from uncommon, and as being
perpetrated without any feelings of remorse, but almost exclusively
upon females. Among the immense population which
live in boats, and upon the rivers of China, it is impossible to
calculate how many are disposed of by being drowned. But,
in Pekin, Barrow gives the average number destroyed, at
twenty-four every day. Some allowance must, however, be
made for those which <i>die of disease</i> during the earliest period
of life in a country where medical science is at so low an ebb.</p>

<p>With the exception of some of the Tartar towns, such as
Chapoo and Chin-keang-foo, where wholesale murder was
committed by the men upon their wives and children immediately
the places were captured, little evidence was obtained
of the existence of the revolting practice of infanticide. We
have seen that at Amoy the bodies of several infants were
found sewed up in sacks; and it was also said that a cave
was found at Chinhae, in which were a number of bodies of
female infants, also tied up in bags. But it was an extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
rare thing to find an infant abandoned in the streets alive or
dead. An instance, however, occurred at Ningpo one evening,
when Captain Hall and a party from the Nemesis were
returning towards their boats. They were just passing a joss-house,
or temple, when something attracted attention lying
upon the steps leading to the entrance. On examination, it
proved to be a female infant (always females) recently abandoned,
and though extremely cold, still living. The little
thing was carried down to the boat by a marine, who was the
orderly. Every attempt was made as soon as it was brought
on board to revive it, but without success.</p>

<p>Infanticide undoubtedly does exist in China, but it may be
suspected that the statements of its prevalence have been
exaggerated, and certainly it is confined to the lower classes,
among whom the means of subsistence press very heavily.
The Chinese are generally remarkably fond of their children.
A Chinaman's three great wishes and most cherished hopes
are&mdash;length of days, plenty of <i>male</i> offspring, and literary
honours. To be the patriarch of a long line of descendants
is generally the aim of his proudest ambition.</p>

<p>After a delay of two or three days at Chinhae, the Nemesis
was sent over to Chusan at the end of November, whither the
admiral, and Sir Henry Pottinger, had already preceded her.
Great changes and improvements were found to have taken
place, even in this short space of time. The shops were now
all open, and the streets filled with people, who were pursuing
their ordinary avocations without any appearance of alarm or
fear of interruption. In fact, they were settling down very
quietly under our rule, much more so than on the former
occasion when the town was in our occupation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>The eventful year of 1841 was now drawing fast to a close.
The troops at Ningpo had been moved into more convenient
quarters for the winter, the close of which was anxiously
looked for in the hope that sufficient reinforcements would
arrive to be able to commence the next campaign with vigour.
The weather set in intensely cold, in the middle of December.
On the 14th of that month, the hills were all covered with
snow, which soon began to fall heavily in the town as well,
and proved that although the summers are very warm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
China, the winters are intensely cold and trying. The health
of the troops continued good, supplies were tolerably abundant,
and the officers managed to beguile the time by shooting-parties
in the neighbourhood, where plenty of game, woodcocks,
snipes, pheasants, &amp;c., were to be found.</p>

<p>For some time, as was before stated, reports had been
brought in of the assembling of large bodies of Chinese troops
in some of the neighbouring towns, with the object, it was
supposed, of preventing the people from holding friendly
communications with us, and perhaps also to threaten us with
an attempt to recover the city. The continuance of frosty
weather, which rendered their soft paddy-fields firm and fit
for operations, determined the general to make a military
expedition as far as Yuyow, in order to ascertain how far
these reports were correct, and to dislodge the Chinese troops
if any of them should be found collected there.</p>

<p>On the 27th of December, the three steamers, Nemesis,
Sesostris, and Phlegethon, having a number of boats in tow,
and carrying altogether about seven hundred men, including
the marines and seamen, proceeded up the north-western
branch of the river. The Nemesis conveyed Sir Hugh Gough,
Sir William Parker, and a detachment of the 18th Royal
Irish, together with a small detachment of artillery. The
Sesostris, owing to her greater draught of water, was compelled
to bring up below the intended point of debarkation.
A few miles below the town a party of Chinese soldiers were
dispersed who had evidently been employed to stake the river
across, which they had already commenced.</p>

<p>In the evening, the Nemesis and Phlegethon anchored close
off the town of Yuyow, when crowds of Chinese were observed
running down to their boats and trying to make their escape
up the river. The troops were disembarked without delay,
and took possession of a small undefended battery of four
guns recently erected, and then marched up the hill overlooking
the city, without opposition, and took up their
quarters for the night in the joss-house, or temple, upon the
top of it, from which a good view of the country had been
obtained on a former occasion.</p>

<p>The city was said to be occupied by upwards of a thousand
troops, and preparations were made for escalading the walls
on the following morning, when the seamen and marines were
landed with that object, under the admiral in person.</p>

<p>Just at the critical moment, some of the respectable inhabitants
came out, and stated that the garrison had withdrawn
during the night, and that the gates were open for us. It was
little expected that treachery was intended, and the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
with the marines and seamen, entered the town in two divisions;
and having got upon the ramparts, they followed them
in opposite directions, in order to go round the town and meet
at the opposite side. At the same time, the Nemesis weighed
and moved a little higher up the river; and from the mast-head
it was distinctly seen that a body of Chinese troops were
drawn up outside the town, close to a bridge leading over a
canal. The boats were, therefore, sent further up the river,
manned and armed, in case the Chinese should attempt to
escape in that direction.</p>

<p>Just at this time, the Chinese opened a fire of ginjals and
matchlocks upon the naval division, as they were advancing
along the wall of the town; but our troops, after some little
delay, having found their way out of the town by the northern
gate, closely pursued the enemy, who had already taken flight.
The Nemesis, and subsequently the Phlegethon, opened fire
on them the moment they were perceived.</p>

<p>The pursuit was a toilsome one, owing to the peculiar character
of the frozen paddy-fields, covered with snow, which the
Chinese could scramble over faster than our own men; but
some of the Chinese were killed, and some were taken prisoners.
Most of them threw off their thick wadded jackets, and flung
away their arms, and having a good knowledge of the country,
and of the direction of the causeways, which were completely
covered with snow, were able to make good their escape. The
pursuit was discontinued, after following them seven or eight
miles; but a military station, which was passed in the way,
was set fire to and destroyed.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the boats of the Nemesis, under Captain
Hall, having pushed on some way up the river, had overtaken
two mandarin boats, which were trying to escape. A quantity
of official papers were found in them, together with some
Sycee silver, which was handed over to the prize-agents; some
valuable fur cloaks were also taken, and the boats were then
burned, the people belonging to them being first sent ashore.
Several farm-houses on shore were then searched for troops,
but none were found. At some distance, however, some men
were seen carrying a handsome mandarin chair in great haste
across the country. Chase was given, and it was soon overtaken;
but, instead of a mandarin, it was found to contain a
very good-looking young <i>mandarin's lady</i>, with an infant in
her arms, and a quantity of trinket-boxes. The poor thing was
much frightened, but was allowed to be carried on without
molestation. On returning to the boats, they were pushed up
further, in the direction in which our troop had followed the
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>At Yuyow, an extensive depôt was discovered outside the
town, containing ammunition, arms, and clothing, and was
totally destroyed. Four guns, which were discovered concealed
near the landing-place, were embarked on board the
steamer. It was now evident that the reports which had been
brought to us concerning the preparations of the Chinese were
perfectly correct.</p>

<p>In the town itself there was nothing particularly worthy of
attention; and on the 30th, our force was re-embarked, and
the steamers returned down the river, and came to anchor for
the night, as near as they could to the town of Tszekee, which
lies, as before stated, about four miles from its banks. On
marching up to it the following day, it was found unoccupied;
and even the authorities of the town, alarmed by the intelligence
from Yuyow, had fled from the place. The inhabitants
appeared peaceably inclined; and, in order the better to conciliate
them, and to shew that our measures were solely directed
against their government, the large public stores of rice were
distributed to the poor people of the place. The same evening,
our force returned to Ningpo, having, during these five days,
succeeded in spreading the alarm throughout all the adjacent
country, and in destroying all the reliance of the people in the
power of their own troops to protect them.</p>

<p>The year 1841 had now closed, and it had been the most
eventful one since the commencement of our difficulties with
the Chinese. Our measures had assumed a new character of
vigour, while treaties had been made and unmade by the
Chinese with almost equal facility. But deep and lasting
humiliation had been inflicted upon them; the honour of the
English flag had been vindicated, and the strength of her
arms had been tried, and proved to be irresistible to the
Chinese.</p>

<p>It was soon discovered that the effect of our descent upon
Yuyow, and our visit to Tszekee, had been to spread the
utmost consternation through all the district, and to alarm
even the high officers at the provincial capital, Hang-chow-foo.
The imperial commissioner and many of the wealthy
inhabitants now fled out of that city, and sought refuge in
Soo-chow-foo, nearly one hundred miles further to the northward.
In fact, there was a general dread of our immediate
advance upon the former city; and there is little doubt that
the general would have gladly undertaken the expedition, had
he possessed sufficient force to do so without giving up
Ningpo.</p>

<p>Some encouragement was given to this flattering expectation,
by the fact of the Phlegethon steamer and the Bentinck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
surveying vessel being sent, early in January, to examine the
great bay of Hang-chow-foo, and the port of Chapoo, which,
as it were, commands the approach to the city, and is the
centre of its commerce. This hoped-for movement in advance,
however, never took place. But, with a view to keep up in
the minds of the Chinese the impression which had been produced
by our movement upon Yuyow by the north-western
branch of the river, a similar attack was projected upon Fungwah,
which lies nearly at the same distance up the south-western
branch. No authorized expedition had yet been made
to explore this branch; but, on two occasions, Captain Hall
and some of his officers and men had proceeded a considerable
way up, partly moved by curiosity, and partly with a view to
examine the river. On one occasion, they must have nearly
reached the city of Fungwah itself.</p>

<p>In both these excursions, the Chinese seemed very much
astonished and alarmed at the boldness of the attempt. The
first excursion was merely a walking and shooting party, but
enough was seen of the country to distinguish it as a rich,
well-cultivated, and picturesque tract. The small cotton-plant
was cultivated in great abundance, and the women (at least
the elder ones) sat quietly at their doors, busy at the spinning
wheel, without appearing to be much alarmed. Several
canals were observed close to the river side, but not flowing
into or communicating directly with it. They were separated
from it by rather a steep <i>inclined plane</i>, <i>made of stone-work</i>,
intended as a substitute for locks, with strong windlasses for
the purpose of hauling the boats up on one side, and letting
them down on the other; certainly an original and curious
contrivance.</p>

<p>The second excursion was much more extensive, and was
made in one of the steamers' cutters up the river. On passing
through the first village, four shots were heard, but it was difficult
to say whether they were fired at the boat, as the shots
were not seen to fall. The river was found to be remarkably
tortuous, so as to appear sometimes, when viewed from a distance,
as if it ran in contrary directions. Numerous pretty-looking
villages were passed without any appearance of hostility;
and, at the distance of about eighteen miles, the river
was found to divide into two branches, one of which continued
in a westerly direction, and the other ran about south-east.
Following the latter a short distance farther, a well-built stone
bridge was discovered, with five arches, the centre one about
twenty feet above the water, which was here from five to six
fathoms deep; the span of the principal arch was thirty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
feet, and upon the top of the bridge was a sort of sentry-box,
or small look-out place, secured with a padlock.</p>

<p>Near at hand, upon the left bank of the river, was a very
pretty village, in which there was one large house, distinguished
from the others by having Chinese characters carved
upon it, the meaning of which, of course, could not be ascertained.
About a quarter of a mile above the bridge, the banks
of the river were studded with well-built houses, surrounded
by groves of trees, among which the tallow-tree was the most
striking, by the peculiar reddish tint of its foliage at that time
of year. The course of the river was now about south-east,
and it was still nearly one hundred yards broad, with three
fathoms water.</p>

<p>Three miles above the first bridge a second one was discovered,
and the river now turned due south. A little beyond
this point the party landed, as it was now getting late, and
ascended a hill upon the left bank of the river, from which
there was a beautiful view of the surrounding country and the
hills in the distance. A high pagoda could be distinguished
some way off to the westward, and a round, white watch-tower,
or look-out house, upon a hill to the eastward, covered with
fir-trees, about a mile distant. At first the villagers seemed
terribly frightened, but, soon perceiving that no mischief was
intended, they approached with the utmost eager curiosity,
anxious to examine everything, particularly the boat and the
men's clothes. Their manner was respectful and orderly,
which is generally the case with the Chinese, if properly
treated.</p>

<p>It was now time to descend the river, although the flood-tide
was still making. On approaching the principal stone
bridge, it was found crowded with people, so that it was necessary
to arrange some plan of defence, in case their purpose
should prove to be one of hostility rather than of curiosity.
If necessary, Captain Hall resolved that all the party should
hastily land at the extremity of the bridge, except two men,
who were as quickly as possible to push the boat through the
nearest arch, and then pull it across to the opposite side;
while those who had landed were to force their way across the
bridge, and re-embark in the confusion on the opposite side.
On coming up to the bridge, however, no opposition was
offered, and indeed it was noticed that there were a number of
women among the lookers-on, and that many others were
hobbling out of their houses, led by irresistible curiosity to
get a first look at the strangers. Abundance of wild fowl
were seen along the banks of the river, several of which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
shot; and, late in the evening, the party again reached their
vessel at Ningpo, well rewarded for the day's excursion. The
small walled town of Fungwah is situated less than thirty miles
up this same branch of the river.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, the General started from Ningpo,
with the object of making a descent upon Fungwah, in the
expectation that some military stores, and probably a small
body of Chinese soldiers, would be discovered. The Nemesis
and Phlegethon were both employed on this service; the
former vessel carrying detachments of the 49th, 18th, and
55th regiments, with artillery, sappers and miners, and followers,
and having also on board Sir Hugh Gough and Sir
William Parker, with their suites. Several boats were also
taken in tow. As the steamers could not pass beyond the
first bridge, the troops were all landed at that point, with Sir
Hugh Gough at their head, intending to march direct upon
Fungwah, while the Admiral continued to advance up the
river, with the boats carrying the seamen and marines. No
opposition was met with, and both divisions arrived simultaneously
at the city walls. It was found that the Chinese
soldiers had abandoned the place, and the authorities had also
fled. The inhabitants and the neighbouring peasantry all
seemed peaceably inclined, though apparently overcome with
astonishment and curiosity. The prospect from the hills at
the back of Fungwah was very striking, and abundance of rice
and other grain crops appeared to be cultivated.</p>

<p>On the following morning, nothing remained to be done
but to destroy the government buildings, and to distribute the
contents of the public granaries to the people, as had been the
case in other places. In the afternoon, the whole force rejoined
the steamers, and next day returned to Ningpo.</p>

<p>The effect of these various movements must be viewed, not
as involving matters of military skill or courage, but as calculated
to have the most salutary effect upon the people and
upon the government, not only by the alarm which they
created, but by the good feelings and forbearance which was
uniformly shewn towards the inhabitants, when in our power,
and <i>abandoned</i> by their own authorities.</p>

<p>The result of the examination, by the Phlegethon and the
Bentinck, of the character of Hang-chow-foo Bay, appears at
this time to have rather discouraged the idea of advancing
upon the capital by the river which leads up to it. The tides
were found to be so strong at the mouth of the river, that it
was impossible to attempt to push even a steamer up, with
any degree of safety. The Phlegethon made the attempt to
enter the river's mouth, but became perfectly unmanageable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and was very nearly carried upon a sand-bank, where she would
probably have been lost. She was, however, got out of danger
with some difficulty when the tide slackened, which it does
very suddenly in that part. But no power of steam and sails
combined was sufficient to stem the current, which seemed to
hold the vessel completely at its mercy for some minutes.</p>

<p>A reconnoissance of the position of Chapoo, however, sufficed
to shew that it was accessible to our ships, and could be
reduced without much difficulty; in which case, the road to
Hang-chow-foo, by the hills, would be open to us, with a good
causeway the whole distance of about fifty miles to the capital.</p>

<p>We may judge of the size and volume of water in most of
the Chinese rivers, by the fact, that, even at Hang-chow-foo,
the river is not less than four miles broad, opposite the city,
at high water; while the rapidity of the current may be judged
of by the fact of its diminishing to about two miles in breadth,
at low water, leaving a fine level strand as far down as the
eye can reach towards the sea. This was noticed during the
short visit paid to it by Lord Macartney's embassy.</p>

<p>Rumours now continued to be brought, of the arrival of
reinforcements at Hang-chow-foo, and other parts of the province;
and, before the end of February, Sir Hugh Gough also
received reinforcements, by the arrival of part of the 26th
regiment, in the Jupiter troop-ship. The Cornwallis arrived
at Chusan in January, for the flag of Sir William Parker,
having succeeded in beating up the whole way from Hong-Kong,
against the north-east monsoon, contrary to the anticipations
of many, who doubted whether so heavy a ship
would be able to accomplish it. The movement upon Hang-chow-foo,
however, if at any time seriously thought of, seems
now to have been quite abandoned; and, as we shall presently
see, Chapoo was destined to be the grand point of attack for
opening the next campaign.</p>

<p>In January, Sir Henry Pottinger and Sir William Parker
went over to spend some time at Chusan, in the Nemesis,
which vessel now required considerable repairs, and was
ordered to undergo a thorough refit. It is astonishing how
easily an iron vessel can be repaired. At Amoy, a large hole
had been knocked in her bottom; and from being so continually
employed in exploring rivers, running along coasts,
and landing troops, it is not surprising that some repair was
required; but it is worthy of remark, that she had been able
to do her duty so long and so well without it.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 5th of March, the arrival of the Clio,
Captain Troubridge, was announced, (fourteen days only from
Hong-Kong,) bringing the mails, and the joyful news of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
promotions in the service, consequent upon the taking of
Canton, and the exploits in the Canton River.</p>

<p>On the 7th of March the Nemesis was sent to reconnoitre
Chusan, having Captain Collinson also on board, for the purpose
of making surveying observations during the trip. They
passed round the western and northern sides of the island,
and having reached Tai-shan, which is about six or seven miles
distant from it, they steamed all round that island, looking
into the different bays, and spying into the villages, to see if
they could discover a camp, or any signs of the presence of
any troops. The navigation round the island is dangerous,
for there are several rocks, at different points, barely covered
with water.</p>

<p>At length they anchored off a small town in a bay on the
south-eastern side of the island, where several junks were seen
at anchor. To the north-east of the town stood a remarkable
hill, from which it was expected that a view of the whole island
could be obtained. Here the officers landed, with Captain
Collinson's boat's crew, and part of that of the steamer, together
with eight artillery men. There was no appearance of hostility,
and they all marched on to a second village, in which,
as well as in the first one, it was asserted by the people that
there were no soldiers left in the island, as they had all gone
away to another island in the neighbourhood. The party then
returned on board, and the steamer moved up towards a creek,
at which the water was too shallow for her to enter.</p>

<p>In the evening Captain Collinson again landed in his gig,
with a view to ascend to the top of the hill; and so confident
was he that there were no armed men upon the island, that
he declined taking an escort with him, and was with some
difficulty persuaded to allow two armed artillerymen to follow
him, and was himself quite unarmed. Lieutenant Bates accompanied
him. Scarcely had they reached the top of the
hill, and were beginning to take their observations, when a
large body of armed Chinese were observed, emerging from
their hiding-places in the creek in which they had landed,
which was at a point about two and a half miles from the
steamer. Evidently their intention was to cut off their retreat,
and make them prisoners. Flight was therefore the only
resource, and had it not been for the assistance of the two
artillerymen, they would have stood little chance of effecting
their retreat to the boat. These two men, however, by coolly
retreating alternately, the one firing, while the other reloaded
as he withdrew towards the landing-place, managed to keep
the Chinese in check, so that Captain Collinson reached the
boat in safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now a question what steps were best to be taken on
the following day; for there could be little doubt that if the
steamer left the island without landing a body of men to
attack the Chinese soldiers, who evidently were in force, a
report would be sent to the Emperor of a great victory having
been gained, in which the barbarians were, of course, driven
into the sea, and their vessels sent away from the coast. It
was therefore resolved to <i>make an impression</i> upon them; and
accordingly at five o'clock in the morning, the four boats of
the steamer, manned and armed, under Captain Collinson and
Captain Hall, with Lieutenant Bates, Mr. Freeze, and other
officers of the ship, pushed off from the vessel, and proceeded
up the creek. They had also eight artillerymen with them;
and the two engineers likewise volunteered their services.
The party numbered altogether sixty-six, including officers.</p>

<p>About two miles and a half up the creek they discovered a
number of transport junks, crowded with Chinese soldiers,
with their banners flying. A little distance from the banks of
the creek, which gradually sloped up towards some detached
houses above, were posted another body of the enemy; altogether,
there were probably five or six hundred men.</p>

<p>Gradually, as the boats advanced, the soldiers who had not
before landed joined the other body on shore, and commenced
a distant fire of ginjals and matchlocks, without doing any
mischief. It was, however, returned by the boats as they
neared them, and their crews were just about to land, when a
thick smoke was observed to issue from one of the nearest
troop boats. It immediately occurred that this might arise
from a train having been laid to blow up the boats if they
should be taken possession of. It was therefore thought
prudent to land a little lower down.</p>

<p>The moment the boats began to descend, the Chinese,
thinking they were retreating, set up a loud shout, and advanced
upon them, brandishing their spears in defiance,
thinking that the victory was already won. In this they were
soon to be undeceived. Our men all landed as quickly as possible,
and were formed into two columns; the right, or advanced
one, led by Captain Hall himself, and the left by Mr.
Freeze (mate R.N.), the chief officer of the Nemesis. Immediately
they were ordered to advance, the Chinese began to
waver at their bold front, and the first volley poured into
them, within pistol-shot, completely put them to flight.
They were now so closely pursued that their military chest
was captured, in charge of a mandarin and two soldiers, who
were killed. The prize was found to consist of only two thousand
dollars, but even that was a pleasant addition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
prize fund. The Chinese were pursued for some distance,
about fifty of them being left upon the field, and eight taken
prisoners. The houses on the rising ground above, in which
some of the soldiers had been quartered, and also several of
the transport junks in the creek, were immediately set on fire.</p>

<p>After collecting some of the scattered arms, as trophies of
victory, the little party again returned to the steamer, the
Chinese having been totally dispersed. She rejoined the
Admiral, at Chusan, the same evening.</p>

<p>So far this little gallant affair had been perfectly successful,
in discovering the rendezvous of the Chinese; but it was
believed that many of their soldiers had already crossed over
to Chusan, disguised as peasants, in readiness to act in concert
with other parties, whenever the attack should be made
on the island. Captain Collinson was, therefore, sent back
again in the Bentinck, with orders to prevent the escape of the
soldiers from the island of Tai-shan, and the Nemesis was
directed to follow as soon as she could get in her fuel.</p>

<p>It was now discovered that the Chinese had managed to
extinguish the flames in their boats before they were seriously
injured, and had by this means made their escape over to
Chapoo. But the Admiral afterwards made a personal examination
of the island, with a party of seamen and marines of
the Cornwallis. No military depôt was discovered, but two
government stations were completely destroyed. The effect
of this spirited discomfiture of the Chinese, at Tai-shan, was
to secure Chusan from future hostile attacks.</p>

<p>The assembling of these troops so close to Chusan was,
doubtless, connected with the grand scheme of attack upon all
our positions, which was attempted, at this very time, more
particularly against Ningpo and Chinhae. It was probably
also well known to the Chinese that Sir Hugh Gough was
absent at Chusan, whither he had proceeded, in consequence
of rumours afloat concerning the projected attack on that
place.</p>

<p>The Chinese seem to have planned their attacks remarkably
well; but so many reports had been before brought in, of
some projected operations by the Chinese, that at length very
little attention came to be paid to them; and when it was
positively asserted by Mr. Gutzlaff, the interpreter, on the
evening of the 9th, that, from certain information which he
had received, there could be no doubt of a grand attack being
resolved on that very night, no one really believed that anything
of a serious nature would occur. It was doubted whether
the Chinese, after their recent defeats, would have the moral
courage to become themselves the <i>aggressors</i>. There were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
external indications of any preparations for an attack, although
some of the inhabitants were seen leaving the town on that
day; and many of the tradesmen, with whom our men were
in the habit of dealing, plainly told them that they would have
hot work that night. All this was treated merely as a specimen
of Chinese bravado.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that we should have had no certain tidings
of the collection and preparation of such a vast number of
fire-rafts and vessels, higher up the river, as soon proved to
have been the case, for the iron steamers might at all times
have been sent up, to ascertain how far any such reports were
well grounded. The fact is, the Chinese <i>did</i> take us a little
by surprise, and that is often the result of holding an enemy
too cheap, and having too great a confidence in one's own
resources. Circumstances favoured them to a certain extent;
the smallness of our force rendered it impossible to keep a
line of sentries along the whole circuit of the walls, which
were nearly five miles round; the extent and nearness of the
suburbs beyond the gates gave the enemy an easy approach
without being observed, and the darkness of the night favoured
the attempt.</p>

<p>The first intimation of the attack was by the firing of two
guns which the Chinese had brought down to the river's
bank, against H.M.S. Columbine, which, together with the
Modeste, was anchored before the town, as were also the
H.C. steamers, Queen and Sesostris. This was at half-past
twelve, P.M. But the firing was not repeated, (it
having probably been only meant for a signal,) and nothing
further occurred until about three o'clock; but, by this time,
the garrison were under arms.</p>

<p>Four fire-rafts were now discovered dropping down the
river, from its south-western branch, (leading to Fungwah,)
towards the Sesostris; and, but for the quickness with which
one of her cables was slipped, and the assistance of her own
boats, aided by two other boats from the Modeste, in towing
them clear towards the shore, they would have been across
the hawse of the Sesostris. Fortunately the rafts took the
ground clear of the steamer, and exploded without doing
any mischief.</p>

<p>All this time, the Chinese kept up a fire of small arms
from the banks of the river, but without effect. But the
Modeste, which was a little lower down the river, below the
Sesostris, opened her broadside upon the eastern suburb, with
the object of stopping the advance of the Chinese in that
direction, and on the following morning it was discovered that
her fire had demolished the walls of one or two houses, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
fell in, and disabled the gun which had been brought down
on purpose to attack the Modeste.</p>

<p>So far, then, the attempt upon the river-side proved a total
failure; but it served as a signal for the general attack upon
the town, which began simultaneously at the southern and
western gates. The extreme darkness of the night rendered
it at first impossible for those who were at a distance to ascertain
the precise points of attack. The principal assault, in
the first instance, seems to have been upon the south gate,
from within and without at the same time. The alarm was
given, the bugles sounded throughout the town, and word was
brought to Colonel Morris, who commanded the garrison,
that the guard at the south gate had been driven in, and the
same intelligence was also brought to Colonel Montgomerie,
commanding the Madras artillery, who were already under
arms upon the ramparts.</p>

<p>A company of the 49th, under Captain M'Andrew, was
immediately ordered up by Colonel Morris towards the south
gate, which they were to retake, if it was found to have been
carried by the enemy. At the same time, Colonel Montgomerie,
with two howitzers, and a party of artillerymen
armed with fusils, commanded by Captain Moore, and reinforced
by a strong patrol of the 18th, under Lieutenant
Murray, proceeded also towards the south gate, which he now
found in the possession of Captain M'Andrew and his company,
who had gallantly <i>retaken</i> the gate, after charging
down the street which led to it, driving the Chinese before
him with the bayonet, and killing a great many of them. The
Chinese had penetrated as far as the market-place; many of
them had scaled the walls, and were seen upon the ramparts;
but upon being challenged, and seeing the troops advancing,
most of them jumped back again over the ramparts, and
in this way many were killed, or were shot at random as they
were seen running away. Thus the south gate was completely
cleared.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that a good number of the
Chinese soldiers must have previously come into the town in
disguise, for the gates were attacked simultaneously both <i>from
within</i> and <i>from without</i>. The movements of the Chinese
were so well concerted, that their approach was not discovered
until they actually attacked the gates, and gallantly
succeeded in <i>scaling the walls</i>. Had not the alarm been
given by the firing of the ships in the river, and had the
Chinese been well officered, it would have caused us heavy
fighting to have ultimately dislodged them from the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
a part of which was, for a few minutes, in their possession.
But even their successes, such as they were, only served to
embarrass them, for they did not know how to turn them to
account. It should be remarked, however, that Sir Hugh
Gough had skilfully disposed his troops long before this event,
by concentrating them in one part of the town, where their
quarters were close to each other, and where they could be
mutually supported in case of attack.</p>

<p>It was afterwards discovered that the attacking party were
a new body of picked men, from a distant province, who had
never yet come into contact with our troops. Money was
also found upon the persons of those who were killed, four or
five dollars upon each, which had probably been given to them
either as arrears of pay, or as a sort of bribe or extra allowance
to induce them to fight. But other incentives were also
employed, for some of the wounded prisoners were evidently
under the excitement of opium. Many of them were remarkably
athletic, fine-looking men, and everything tended to
prove that this was a grand and desperate effort.</p>

<p>Daylight was beginning to dawn, and the west gate was at
this time found to be the principal scene of action; indeed, it
was in that direction that the <i>main body</i> of the Chinese seem
to have advanced. Orders had been sent to reinforce the
guard at the west gate with the grenadiers of the 49th, and
Colonel Morris also hurried up to it in person, with another
company of the 49th; while Colonel Montgomerie, with the
artillery, having been joined by Colonel Mountain, with a
party of the 26th, proceeded on in the same direction.</p>

<p>On arriving at the west gate, it was found to have been
gallantly and successfully defended by Lieutenant Armstrong,
who commanded the guard of the 18th, assisted by a small
detachment of the 49th, under Lieutenant Grant. The enemy
had attacked it in great force, rushing boldly up to the very
gate, which they attempted to force, while others were
endeavouring to scale the wall. The grenadiers of the 49th
arrived just in time to assist in completing the repulse of the
Chinese.</p>

<p>Colonel Montgomerie, having now come up with his reinforcement,
dashed at once through the gateway in pursuit, the
enemy having been driven across a small bridge into the
suburbs. Numerous dead bodies of Chinese were found close
to the gate, but they appeared to be in great force in the
suburbs, from which a smart but ineffectual fire of matchlocks
was kept up. A few shells were thrown into the suburbs
from the two howitzers; but it was evidently necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
continue the pursuit through the suburbs, for the Chinese
appeared to be in full retreat across a bridge at some distance
down, which seemed to be the principal thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Our force on the spot was extremely small, amounting,
when they had all fallen in, including artillerymen, to not
more than one hundred and twenty-six rank and file, and ten
officers. But with this small force Colonel Montgomerie
determined to dash on, being assisted throughout by Colonel
Mountain, C.B., Deputy-Adjutant-General; and, accordingly,
they immediately advanced up the principal narrow street of
the suburbs. Having followed it for about half a mile, they
came upon the main body of the enemy, who crowded the
whole length of the street in a dense column, but without
appearing to be at all wavering or inclined to give way. On
the contrary, a high officer on horseback was seen to encourage
the men, who set up a great shouting, and brandished
their swords and spears in defiance. But in a narrow street
the dense mass was necessarily incommoded by its own numbers,
and the steady fire of the head of our column, as they
advanced upon them&mdash;one section delivering its fire, and the
next taking its place for the first to reload&mdash;brought down all
their foremost and boldest men, every shot telling with unerring
certainty. They could neither advance to charge our
column, nor could they retreat, as long as the rear of their
column chose to hold their ground.</p>

<p>On coming up within about fifty paces of them, the two
howitzers were ordered up to the front, while a party of the
18th, under Lieutenant Murray and Lieutenant Molesworth,
of the artillery, were ordered round by a side lane to act upon
the enemy's flank; Colonel Mountain and Colonel Montgomerie
also went round, (having first waded across a canal,)
and witnessed the terrific effect of the fire of three rounds of
grape, in quick succession, from the howitzers, which dealt
terrible havoc among them. At the same time, the detachment
of the 18th fired upon them down the lane as they fled,
and a more complete scene of discomfiture and slaughter could
not be imagined.</p>

<p>The Chinese were soon in full flight in all directions across
the country, the main body of them retreating along the
banks of a canal in a continued line, not less than a mile
long, while numerous smaller parties broke off from the main
body, and tried to escape the best way they could. Many
were supposed to have been drowned in the canal. The
pursuit was followed up for about seven or eight miles, and
the loss of the enemy was estimated altogether at not less than
from five to six hundred men, and only thirty-nine prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
were taken. On our side, one man only was killed, and a few
were wounded. The principal loss of the Chinese was inflicted
by the fire of the howitzers upon their dense masses,
in the narrow street, and the sustained fire of our column as
it advanced upon them. Not a few, however, were killed inside
the walls of the city. The force they brought against us
is supposed to have exceeded five thousand men, consisting
of their best soldiers, and a great part of them were evidently
under the excitement of opium.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the boats of the Modeste and Sesostris
moved up the south-west branch of the river, in search of fire-boats,
but found none. In the afternoon, however, the boats
of the Columbine, under Captain Morshed, together with the
Queen steamer, proceeded up the other, or north-western
branch, and discovered, not far up, thirty-seven fire-vessels.
They were all in a state of perfect preparation, being filled
with combustibles and jars of powder, and also provided with
<i>leather caps and fire-proof dresses</i> for the men who were to
have the charge of them; each of them had also a small punt,
or sampan, attached, for the escape of those on board. The
early discovery of those which were first sent down, or probably
their having been sent adrift too soon down <i>the other
branch</i> of the river, had evidently disconcerted this part of their
plan. The whole of these boats were scuttled and destroyed.</p>

<p>Some miles higher up, near Tsekee, many more junks, of
every size and shape, were found filled with combustibles;
and still more were discovered higher up, moored on each side
of the river. It was also observed, that on the hills opposite
Tsekee, there were three Chinese encampments, one of which
was set on fire by the soldiers, as the boats approached. In
fact, it became evident that preparations of a much more extensive
kind than we could have anticipated, had been made,
for one grand combined effort to drive us into the sea, before
reinforcements could join us.</p>

<p>The attack upon Chinhae took place about the same time,
but was much less important in its nature, and conducted with
less vigour and resolution, than that on Ningpo. Early on
the morning of the 10th March, the alarm was given that ten
fire-vessels were floating down the river towards the ships of
war and transports at anchor off Chinhae. The boats of the
Blonde and the Hyacinth, under Commander Goldsmith of the
latter vessel, and Lieutenant Dolling of the former, immediately
dashed at them, and drove them on shore, out of the way of
the shipping, where they exploded.</p>

<p>About the same time, a body of Chinese soldiers got up
close to the west gate of Chinhae, without being discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
until they opened a fire of ginjals, and attempted to force their
way in. But Captain Daubeny, with a company of the 55th,
immediately sallied out of the gate, and pursued them into the
suburbs, whence they fled towards a joss-house, or temple,
about a mile from the walls, where they joined the main body,
about twelve hundred strong. Colonel Schoedde, with three
companies of the 55th, now joined Captain Daubeny, and
immediately charged them, and put them to flight. But it
was very difficult to follow, or come within musket range of
them, owing to the peculiar nature of the ground, which was
cut up in all directions by water-courses; although the labyrinths
of paths and causeways were, of course, perfectly well
known to the retreating enemy. About thirty of the Chinese
and two of their officers were killed, but the number of
wounded could not be ascertained. A quantity of military
weapons and some powder were captured.</p>

<p>The plans of the Chinese had thus signally failed at all
points of attack; but it must be admitted that at Ningpo they
shewed a great deal of determination and personal courage,
and their plans were, in reality, very well arranged.</p>

<p>Information of these important attacks was immediately sent
over to Sir Hugh Gough and Sir William Parker, who were
at Chusan, and induced the General instantly to return to
Ningpo. Sir William Parker also returned as soon as he had
completed his examination of the island of Tai-shan; and he
brought with him the Phlegethon and Nemesis, merely stopping
at Chinhae on the way, to pick up a few marines and
small-arm men from the Blonde. No time was then lost
in pushing up the south-western branch of the river above
Ningpo, whither the General had preceded him with part of
the 18th and 49th regiments, and two guns, in order to learn
if the enemy were in force there.</p>

<p>Tidings had been brought to Sir Hugh Gough, that a strong
body of several thousand Chinese troops were posted not far
from Fungwah, preparatory to another descent upon Ningpo.
But as soon as he had marched about six or seven miles up,
the Sesostris steamer moving parallel with him by the river,
with part of the 26th regiment on board, positive information was
obtained that the enemy had retreated over the hills the preceding
night, and that it would be useless to attempt to follow them.</p>

<p>It only now remained to advance against the strong body of
the Chinese who were known to be posted along the banks of
the other branch of the river, and who were reported also to
have thrown up strong entrenched camps upon the Segoan
hills, at the back of the town of Tsekee, and to be commanded
by three of their most famous generals.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>A heavy blow had now been inflicted upon the Chinese, by
the severe reverses they had met with at Ningpo and at
Chinhae, and by the defeat of all their designs against Chusan.
It was, therefore, a favourable opportunity to follow up our
successes and turn them to the best advantage, before the
effect of the impression already made could have time to diminish.
It was ascertained that their troops had with difficulty
been kept together after their late defeat; and it was reported
that they were about to retreat towards Pickwan, a town situated
about forty miles higher up the river, at which point they were
said to be concentrating their whole force.</p>

<p>Besides the force said to be encamped above Tsekee, on the
Segoan hills, it was also ascertained that another body of five
or six thousand men was posted in a fortified camp, about
seven miles further along the hills to the north-east, close to
what is called the Chungkie Pass, and that the military chest
of the army was in charge of this division. A Chinese military
chest is generally not very well filled, but still there is to
a soldier something very tempting in the idea of an enemy's
<i>military chest</i>, particularly when there is a prospect of capturing
it.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th of March, the force destined
for the attack, comprising altogether little more than a thousand
men, including the battalion of seamen and marines,
were embarked on board the steamers Nemesis, Phlegethon,
and Queen, from the north gate of the city; the General and
his staff, accompanied by the Admiral and other officers,
taking up their quarters on board the Nemesis, which had
been dexterously brought close into a wharf near the city gate;
so that on this occasion the troops were embarked without the
necessity of using boats. The naval brigade was commanded by
Capt. Bourchier, of the Blonde, assisted by Capt. P. Richards.
There were four 8-pounder guns of the Madras artillery, for
which ponies had been trained, and these were now sent early
in the morning across from Ningpo by land, escorted by a
party of the Madras rifles; by these means the distance was
materially shortened, by cutting off a great bend of the river
above Ningpo. On reaching the nearest point, opposite
Tsekee, the artillery swam their horses across the river, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
were then drawn up in readiness to advance upon the town,
which was about four miles distant. The road to Tsekee and
the nature of the country were already well known, from the
previous visit in the month of December.</p>

<p>Before twelve o'clock, the troops were landed from the
steamers near a village, where there was a sort of jetty convenient
for the purpose; they then formed, and marched
direct up towards the city. At the same time, the Phlegethon
was sent higher up the river, together with the Nemesis and
two boats belonging to the Cornwallis and Blonde, to endeavour
to get near enough to the flank of the Chinese army, to
harass them in their retreat.</p>

<p>The Phlegethon started first, because the Admiral and the
General, who were on board the Nemesis, were unwilling to
land, until they had seen all the rest of the force on shore
before them. But the moment the Admiral had left the
vessel, she was backed out from the landing-place, and went
up the river for some distance, stern-foremost, at full-speed,
until she could be conveniently turned.</p>

<p>Having passed round a considerable bend in the river, some
miles above the landing-place, they turned up a small branch
or creek close to a village, which appeared to lead round
nearer to the enemy's positions. The Phlegethon, which was
some distance ahead, suddenly came upon five gun-boats,
armed and manned, at anchor close to a mandarin station,
which proved to have been used as a depôt for powder and
military stores. Fourteen fire-rafts were also discovered, and
the whole of these warlike preparations were destroyed.</p>

<p>As soon as the troops had marched up pretty close to
Tsekee, they proceeded to occupy a small hill directly in
front of the town, and commanding the southern gate. A
few ginjals and two guns were fired at them from the walls of
the city, but at such a distance as to make it evident that no
serious defence of the place was intended. The main body of
the Chinese army was to be seen encamped upon the heights
to the northward of the town, called the Segoan Hills; and it
was equally evident that the shortest and best mode of advancing
to attack them was by first escalading the walls of the
town, and then marching straight through it to the northern
gate, whence it would be easy to attack the enemy both in
front and on the flank. It was necessary to ascertain whether
the town was occupied by any considerable force (which there
was little reason to expect), and at the same time to deprive
the enemy of having the advantage of falling back upon the
town when driven from the heights. Orders were therefore
given, that the naval brigade, with a party of sappers, covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
by the guns under Colonel Montgomerie, should escalade the
walls at the nearest point, while the 49th were to blow open
the south gate, and immediately join them upon the ramparts.</p>

<p>The 49th, on approaching the gate, found the bridge over a
canal just outside recently destroyed; but, as the water was
shallow, and there appeared to be no likelihood of meeting
with any serious opposition, they quietly crept along the
canal itself, which led into the town, and so got under the
walls, upon the ramparts of which they now found the naval
brigade already drawn up.</p>

<p>The 18th, in the meantime, had been sent round, outside
the walls, to dislodge a body of Chinese troops who occupied
a hill a little to the north-east of the city; and they were
directed to join the rest of our force as soon as they reached
the north gate. The 26th had been held in reserve to protect
the guns, and support the 49th, if necessary. The town was,
however, carried without any resistance; and the troops
having marched round the ramparts, the whole force was then
concentrated at the north gate.</p>

<p>It should here be noticed, that the town of Tsekee lies in a
sort of cup, or basin, surrounded almost entirely on three
sides by steep hills, being open only towards the river, or to
the southward; from the northern hills, a low spur is sent
down towards the northern gate, and terminates in a small
hill within the walls. The Chinese forces were posted upon
these heights, a little to the westward of the spur just
described, but in such a position that their left was commanded
by other hills. On their right they had a second encampment,
a little in advance, on the north-western side of
the town; but it was evident that their left could be easily
turned, and that they could be defeated and completely routed,
without much difficulty.</p>

<p>The General's first movement was to direct the 18th, with
the rifles, to proceed to occupy a hill on his right, which
could only be got at by passing through a steep ravine, but
which quite commanded the Chinese' left. As soon as they
succeeded in crowning its summit, and had thus turned the
Chinese position, the naval brigade (who, in the meantime,
were to occupy two large buildings under the walls, a little on
the north-western side of the town) were to carry the hill in
their front, on which the Chinese were encamped, while the
49th were at the same time to attack the centre of the Chinese
position.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the Chinese, with one or two
trifling exceptions, seem never to have made use of field-artillery.
Of course, where they had forts, they had guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
mounted; but they did not appear to regard artillery as a
necessary part of a regular army.</p>

<p>On this occasion, our loss would probably have been severe,
if the heights had been defended by a numerous artillery;
but they opened a smart fire of ginjals upon the naval brigade
(the Admiral himself being at their head), as they marched
across the paddy-fields outside the walls, with the object of
occupying the two large houses, under shelter of which they
were to form, in readiness for the attack. They suffered some
loss; and, as it appeared that the 18th and rifles, being impeded
by the steepness and difficulties of the gorge they had
to ascend, were longer in reaching the summit of the hill than
had been expected, the General determined to commence the
attack in front without waiting for the 18th to turn the flank
of the Chinese. The advance was sounded, and the 49th,
with the General at their head, rushed up the hill; while the
naval brigade, led by Captains Bourchier and Richards, and
Commander Watson (the Admiral himself taking part in the
attack), made a dash at the other hill, upon the Chinese' right.</p>

<p>Some rockets were fired with great precision into the enemy's
position, by Lieutenant Fitzjames and Mr. Jackson, of the
Cornwallis, but the Chinese poured in a heavy fire of ginjals
and matchlocks upon our troops as they advanced.</p>

<p>The marines and seamen dashed across the paddy-field, and
charged up the hill, which was steep and rugged, with great
spirit, but were boldly met by the Chinese, who did not
shrink from the contest. The leading division soon gained
the summit, and the remainder of the brigade pushed round
the sides of the hill, to cut off the retreat of the enemy. In
this encounter two officers of the Royal Marines and two
officers of the naval battalion were wounded; eleven men were
also wounded and three killed.</p>

<p>The General, at the head of the 49th, in the meantime
carried the hill in his front with great spirit, and detached the
grenadiers, under Major Gough, to cut off a body of Chinese
who were attempting to get up the rear of the other hill,
which had already been carried in front by the naval brigade.
This division of the enemy was, therefore, completely hemmed
in, and the slaughter was unavoidably great in the hollow at
the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>The 49th now continued to press forward, driving the
Chinese before them in great disorder across the plain at the
foot of the hills; and the 18th and Rifles, having by this time
succeeded in turning the enemy's position on the heights,
descended into the plain, and joined the 49th and 26th in the
pursuit. The whole Chinese army was now in full flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
across the plain, towards the Chungkie Pass, and just passed
within range of the Phlegethon and Nemesis, who had taken
up an excellent position in the creek, for the purpose of
cutting them off. Their guns opened fire upon the scattered
fugitives, who suffered severely.</p>

<p>From eight hundred to one thousand men are supposed to
have been killed, wounded, or drowned, in this engagement;
every attempt was made to spare them, but as most of these
troops came from distant provinces, and were reputed to be
their best soldiers, they refused to surrender themselves
prisoners, with few exceptions. Many officers or mandarins
were killed, but only three were taken prisoners. Many of
them deliberately cut their own throats, when they saw that
the day was irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>Some curious and interesting documents were found, relating
to their plans and the disposal of their forces, amongst
which were some public proclamations to be distributed among
the people. Upon the bodies of many of the slain, pieces of
Sycee silver were found, as had been the case at Ningpo, a few
days before.</p>

<p>The strength of the Chinese army was estimated at from
seven to eight thousand men, part of which appeared to be a
picked body, said to belong to the Emperor's guard; they
were fine, athletic, powerful men. It was also remarked that
their arms were of a superior description; several improvements
had been adopted; and the bow and arrow, once the
favourite weapon of the Tartar soldier, had been laid aside on
this occasion.</p>

<p>As usual, several personal encounters took place; the
Chinese not fearing to engage single-handed with their foe, or
to measure their sword with that of our officers. In one of
these combats, Mr. Hodgson, mate of the Cornwallis, was
wounded, not far from the Admiral. Colonel Mountain was
in some danger of being run through, but was saved by a
timely shot from one of the 18th. The clothes of the slain
were in some instances ignited by their matches, and produced,
as on some other occasions, a revolting spectacle.</p>

<p>The night was passed, by our gallant little force, in the
tents from which the Chinese had been driven, and which
were found to contain plenty of warm coverings and provisions,
&amp;c. There were stores of rice, and bread (cakes), and flour,
in abundance.</p>

<p>Besides the loss already mentioned, the 49th had three
officers and four men wounded. Some of our officers were
wounded severely, Lieutenant Lane having had his arm amputated
upon the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning, at daylight, the grain magazines
in the town, belonging to government, were opened to the
people, and, as might be expected, were rapidly emptied. A
large quantity of ginjals, matchlocks, and other warlike implements,
were also collected upon the battle-field, and were
nearly all destroyed. Among other curiosities were nine
newly-invented brass tubes, of about three pounds calibre,
and thirty-nine pounds weight, each with two handles; they
had never been used, but were apparently intended to fire
grape-shot. They were curiously bound round with catgut,
and were probably to be fired while held between two men, as
they were provided with handles for the purpose. One of
them was given to Captain Hall, by the Admiral, and has
since been deposited, with other Chinese weapons, at Windsor.
Twenty-three guns were also captured, principally upon the
walls of the town.</p>

<p>As the enemy had retreated towards the Chungkie Pass,
about six or seven miles distant to the north-west, where it
was reported that another fortified encampment had been
formed, Sir Hugh Gough moved in advance, about one
o'clock on the following day, the 16th; but having reached
the foot of the hills, the position was found completely abandoned,
although it was by nature a strong one. Dispositions
were made for the attack, but none of the enemy were discovered,
and consequently the hoped-for military chest was
not captured. The Chinese had only just withdrawn, for they
had left behind them some ammunition, and a supply of inferior
bread, which is tolerably eatable, however, after a long
march.</p>

<p>Having halted about two or three hours for rest, and after
setting fire to all the buildings, our little army returned to the
town of Tsekee the same evening.</p>

<p>It is proper here to remark that the peasantry, and the inhabitants
generally, except where they happened casually to
be intermingled with the soldiers during the flight, shewed
little concern as to the fate of their countrymen. They appeared
to be more astonished than frightened, particularly at the
swimming of the horses of the artillery across the river, and
then seeing them harnessed to the guns.</p>

<p>The town of Tsekee suffered very little. A large pawnbroker's
shop was one of the greatest curiosities, being filled
with furs, silks, &amp;c. It was a large, extensive building, like
a warehouse, as is commonly the case in China, and it afforded
excellent quarters.</p>

<p>This engagement upon the heights of Segoan has been
considered, by military men, as the most scientifically conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
affair which occurred during the war. Its success, at
all events, was complete; and the Chinese army, which was
now concentrated to the southward of Hang-chow-foo, for the
purpose of covering the provincial capital, against which we
were expected to advance, was said to be with much difficulty
kept together, and to be in great want of supplies. The
orders of the emperor, that the province which was the seat
of the war for the time should defray all its expenses, excited
much discontent, as might be expected.</p>

<p>Any proposed plan of advancing upon Hang-chow-foo
which might have been thought of was now abandoned, and
the great river, the Yangtze-Keang, was designed to be the
principal seat of operations during the ensuing campaign.
The vast inland trade passing through this main artery of the
empire would be stopped; the traffic by the Grand Canal
would be at our mercy; and there seemed every reason to
expect that the presence of a large military and naval force,
in the heart of the country, would lead the haughty Chinese
cabinet to listen to terms of peace, which we hoped to dictate
under the walls of the ancient Chinese capital, the imperial
Nankin, the depository of the ashes of many of the ancient
Emperors of China. Some, however, looked forward to a
hoped-for advance upon Pekin, the great Tartar capital, by the
river Peiho. The result, however, ultimately proved the
wisdom of the former plan of operations.</p>

<p>During the months of April and May, reinforcements continued
to arrive to strengthen the expedition, and the belief
was general that it was determined to put an end to the war
as soon as possible, by some means or other. A fresh corps
of Bengal volunteers, a remarkably fine body of men, arrived
from Calcutta; the 41st and the 2nd native infantry arrived
from Madras, with a reinforcement of artillery, and a few
horses for the guns. Several steamers and ships of war, with
transports, continued to join in succession&mdash;namely, the Vixen
from England, and the Tenasserim, Auckland, Ariadne, Medusa,
and the little Hooghly steamers, belonging to the East
India Company, from Bombay and Calcutta, all well armed,
and some of them peculiarly adapted for river navigation.</p>

<p>The Chinese, finding that they met with no success against
us in the open field, turned their attention more strongly than
ever to their two most notable schemes, of kidnapping our
men, one by one, and destroying our ships by means of fire-rafts.
Large rewards continued to be offered for the capture
of our high officers; but their successes in this system were
confined to the men, some of whom were occasionally carried
off and a few were put to death in the most barbarous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
inhuman manner. Indeed, it was not till after the capture of
Chapoo (the next engagement to be described) that the
Chinese began to treat their prisoners with a little kindness
and mercy.</p>

<p>Many stories of the cleverness of the Chinese in carrying
off prisoners, and of the treatment the latter afterwards met
with, are familiar to the reader. Towards the close of the
war, they were generally pretty well taken care of, for the
Chinese could not be insensible to the kind treatment their
countrymen met with when they fell into our hands. I remember
being nearly caught once at Chusan, just at the close
of the war; and the very next day, an attack was made upon
two of our officers, who made an excursion in the same direction,
and had a very narrow escape. Captain Wellesley, R.N.,
and Ensign Shadwell, of the 55th, were surrounded at less
than a mile from the city gate. The latter shot one of the
Chinamen in the breast with a pistol, (a <i>single</i> pistol is always
useless,) but was immediately taken prisoner by the others,
who were probably soldiers disguised as peasants. His arms
were pinioned, and he was dragged along <i>by the legs</i>. In the
meantime, Captain Wellesley, instead of firing his pistol,
judiciously ran off towards the city gate, to call out the guard;
and the moment the Chinese saw them advancing, they threw
down their prisoner and decamped. He was thus saved.</p>

<p>On some occasions, the Chinese kidnappers had the worst
of it, and were themselves captured: these were principally
sent down to Hong-Kong to work in chains, but some were
kept in prison at Chusan. The respectable inhabitants, however,
were anxious to bring about a more peaceable state of
things, and they stated that the kidnappers were not natives
of the island, but people sent over purposely from the mainland.
It was evident that some secret influence was at work
among the people, and that they still dreaded the power of
their own authorities, and were instigated to annoy us.</p>

<p>At length, the Chinese became better disposed, and then
took to the amusement of making caricatures of us. Many
spirited things of this sort were hawked about, rudely executed
and strangely coloured, but withal amusing specimens of
Chinese drollery. The two annexed sketches, one of an encounter
between our own soldiers and the Tartars, and the
other of an English foraging party, are accurately reduced
from the original Chinese caricatures, and shew more evidence
of fun and quickness than we should have expected among so
grave a people. There were many others equally amusing.
At Ningpo, they made a sort of little peep show of the General
and his staff, intended to be a correct representation of them
in little figures. That of Sir Hugh Gough, with his beautiful
long, grey locks, was fairly done. A capital full-length picture,
in oil, of the General was afterwards executed at Macao by
a Chinese artist, who had been regularly instructed.</p>

<p>The more the Chinese came to mix with us and to be acquainted
with our character, the more they seemed to fall into
our ways; and we cannot but think that, at no distant period,
amicable relations will be established, without difficulty, upon
an intimate footing. It has often been remarked, that in many
respects they resemble Englishmen in their mercantile, industrious
habits, their ingenuity, and their readiness to combine
together for useful purposes, their independent spirit, and
their love of argument. They differ materially from all other
eastern nations with which we have hitherto come in contact.</p>

<p>As soon as the Nemesis had undergone some necessary repairs,
(for which purpose she was beached upon the sands at
Trumball Island,) she was ordered to explore all the neighbouring
islands between Chusan and the Main in search of
fire-vessels, or of other warlike preparations. She was joined
by H.M.S. Clio, which was, however, left at anchor at Keeto
Point, Captain Troubridge himself coming on board the Nemesis,
and bringing one of his boats, manned and armed.
In almost every island or bay they visited along the so-called
Nimrod's Channel, Gough's Passage, Mesan Island, and other
parts to the southward of Chusan, an immense number of fire-boats,
in different stages of preparation, were discovered and
destroyed; and wherever any opposition was offered, the
neighbouring hamlets were burnt.</p>

<p>Two or three days were occupied in this important service,
during which the Nemesis had her false rudder carried away;
and, owing in a great measure to this accident, and to the
remarkable strength of the currents, as she was attempting to
pass between the island of Luhwang and another small one
lying off its eastern point, the current caught her bows, and
threw her heavily, <i>broadside onto the rocks</i>. The vessel was
soon got off again, but she had bilged in the starboard coal-bunker.
The water was pouring in fast, but it was thought
that the engine-pumps would suffice to keep it under, until a
good sandy beach could be found to run her ashore upon.
But the water gained so fast upon the pumps that the fire
would not burn much longer, so that it was necessary to run
her ashore upon the nearest beach. As the tide ebbed, the
water ran out again through the leak; and then by digging a
deep hole in the sand, it was easy to get down below the ship's
bottom, and stop the leak from the outside.</p>

<p>A great many fire-boats had been destroyed upon the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
that day; and, as it was known to be occupied by a body of
Chinese soldiers, a military mandarin on horseback having
also been observed superintending the completion of the fire-boats,
it was possible that an attack might be made on the
vessel at night, and it was therefore prudent to hasten the
repairs. The rent was full three feet in length, but it was
filled up with stout wedges of wood, covered with oakum, and
driven firmly into it <i>from the outside</i>.</p>

<p>To prevent any surprise by the Chinese, sentries were
posted upon the neighbouring hills, to give warning of their
approach; and, by way of being beforehand with them, a
requisition was sent up to the principal village, written in
Chinese, by a Chinese servant on board, demanding from the
head men, or elders of the place, a supply of provisions&mdash;namely,
a couple of bullocks, a dozen geese, two or three
dozen ducks and fowls, and so forth; and <i>threatening</i> to pay
a hostile visit to the village next day, if they did not comply.
After some deliberation, all these things were promised; so
that the authorities, instead of planning an attack upon the
vessel, or any attempt upon the men during the night, had
quite enough to do to collect these supplies by the following
morning. In the meantime, the vessel was repaired and got
off again. Information of the accident was, however, conveyed
to the Admiral by the Clio's boat; and he immediately
sent down the Phlegethon, with the launch of the Cornwallis,
to render assistance. By the time they arrived in the morning,
the vessel was already, to their astonishment, prepared to
proceed to Chusan, where she arrived in the course of the day.</p>

<p>Information of the intended attack on our shipping at
Chusan had been obtained by Captain Dennis, the military
magistrate of Tinghai, late that evening, and was by him
communicated to the Admiral. Orders were therefore sent to
the different ships of war and transports, to be upon the
alert, and have all their boats in readiness. The Nemesis was
the only vessel to which the information was accidentally not
conveyed; probably because it was thought she was ashore.</p>

<p>A little after eleven, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, three divisions of fire-rafts were
observed drifting down towards the shipping, from the
eastern end of the harbour, some from the direction of Sincamoon,
close along the island of Chusan, some between Macclesfield
and Trumball islands, where the Nemesis lay, and
others again outside the latter, by the Sarah Galley passage.
The first intimation of their approach was given by two lights
being observed at some distance; this led to a suspicion of
fire-rafts, and by the time the men had got to quarters, several
of the fire-vessels burst into flames; others were gradually set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
on fire, and were seen to take the three different directions
before described. Nearly twenty of them drifted down between
the islands off which the Nemesis lay; and as they gradually
came within range, her guns opened on them, to try to drive
them on shore. There was a small boat ahead of each raft,
under sail, and with men in it to tow the rafts in the required
direction.</p>

<p>The Nemesis was of course in considerable danger; for
the rafts or fire-boats were chained two and two together, so
as to hang across the ship's bows. Steam was got up as quick
as possible, the cable was ready to be slipped in case of need,
and the steamer's boats were sent out to tow the rafts clear, as
they were rapidly bearing down upon her, with a strong ebb-tide.
They were all in a complete blaze as they drifted past
on either side of her; and so close were they, that it was
necessary to wet the decks and the side of the vessel continually,
on account of the great heat. Her guns continued
to fire at them, in order to sink them, if possible.</p>

<p>Other divisions of the fire-rafts, which came down the
passages before described, were driven ashore by the boats of
the squadron, and blew up, without doing any mischief to our
shipping. Altogether, between fifty and sixty of them at
least had been sent down, from the eastern side of the harbour;
but it was reported that another division of them was
to come down by the western side, from the direction of Sing
Kong, as soon as the tide turned; a division of boats, under
Lieutenant Wise, of the Cornwallis, was therefore sent to
endeavour to find them out and destroy them at once. They
were soon discovered, to the number of thirty, at anchor off a
sandy beach, outside of Bell Island, and their destined work
of mischief was frustrated.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the Nemesis and Phlegethon
steamers were again sent to search through all the adjacent
islands; and the Nemesis succeeded in discovering many
more fire-boats, which were now destroyed, upon the different
islands; stacks of fire-wood and other combustible materials,
which had been collected for the purpose, were likewise set on
fire. In one village, there were a number of boats half filled
with combustible materials; and the whole village was put
into an uproar when the crew of the steamer began to set fire
to them. It turned out that they had been pressed into service
by the mandarins, and the people naturally wished to save
their boats, on which their livelihood depended. Only one
poor old woman, however, was permitted to retain her boat,
for they might all have been pressed by the mandarins again.</p>

<p>A party of armed seamen and marines were now sent up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
towards a hill in the rear of the village, along which a number
of men had been seen retiring, and amongst them a military
mandarin, which made it probable that they were soldiers.
The Chinese made a hasty retreat, but the mandarin was
observed to try to hide himself behind a tombstone while he
pulled off his warm jacket, and nearly all his clothes, and
lastly his satin boots, and then giving them to a man who
attended him, away he ran for his life down the hill on the
opposite side, so that there was no chance of overtaking him.</p>

<p>The Phlegethon had been sent in an opposite direction;
but on that side no fire-boats were discovered, notwithstanding
the active exertions of Lieutenant M'Cleverty. Altogether
not less than one hundred fire-boats were destroyed on these
different occasions, besides those which had been previously
destroyed by the Nemesis, and the boat of the Clio. How
many Chinese lost their lives in the affair it is impossible to
say; but many of them must have been drowned in attempting
to escape on shore, after the fire-rafts burst into flames. In
fact, in all the numerous little sheltered bays among those
islands, fire-rafts were destroyed in greater or lesser numbers.</p>

<p>On one occasion, and without any warning, the Nemesis
ran at full speed, and at high water, upon a dangerous conical-shaped
rock, off the north-eastern extremity of Deer Island,
near the southern coast of Chusan, although she had frequently
been through the same passage before without having
discovered the danger. The tide began to fall almost immediately
she struck, so that she was left with her bows high and
dry, and her stern deep in the water, while she had seven
fathoms close alongside of her. It was a remarkable position
for a vessel to be placed in; part of her bottom was completely
clear of the rock and the water too, the vessel being
only held by its extremities; and when the tide rose, every
attempt to haul her off proved ineffectual. A large indentation,
or hollow, was supposed to have been made where she
rested upon the rock, which of course held her fast.</p>

<p>The only resource was to try to float her off, by fairly lifting
her up, with the help of large casks and junks. The launch
and pinnace of the Cornwallis having been sent to her assistance,
eight large casks were got out, and boats were sent out
to press half-a-dozen of the largest Chinese trading junks to
assist in the operation. As soon as they were brought alongside,
the vessel was lightened, strong hawsers were passed
under her bottom, and were secured over the bows of three
junks, placed on either side, and then carried aft round the
junk's quarter, and thence led forward and secured round the
mast. By these means, as the tide rose, the junks fairly lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the head of the steamer off the rock, and she was launched
into her own element without having sustained any material
injury.</p>

<p>From what has been already stated, it will be readily inferred
that the navigation of the Chusan islands is intricate,
and not unattended with danger.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious and interesting of all these islands
is the consecrated island of Pooto, situated very near the
eastern end of Chusan, and only about sixteen miles distant
from the town of Tinghai. It is a small rocky island, broken
up into numerous picturesque valleys and romantic glens,
the hollows of which are richly cultivated, and abounding in
trees and aromatic shrubs; while from the steep and rugged
heights a most beautiful prospect presents itself on every side,
the waters around it being studded with almost innumerable
islands as far as the eye can reach. But it is most celebrated
for its numerous temples, of which there are said to be nearly
four hundred, (but this number is probably exaggerated,)
dedicated to the idolatrous worship of Foo, or Budha. The
whole island is, in fact, a large monastery, divided into many
brotherhoods. "All the sumptuous and extensive buildings
of this island," says Medhurst, "are intended for no other
purpose than to screen wooden images from the sun and rain;
and all its inhabitants are employed in no other work than
the recitation of unmeaning prayers, and the direction of useless
contemplations towards stocks and stones; so that human
science and human happiness would not be in the least
diminished if the whole of Pooto, with its gaudy temples and
lazy priests, were blotted out from the face of the creation."
Each of the priests is furnished with a <i>string of beads</i>, which
he keeps continually fingering; and as he counts them, he
repeats the same dull monotonous exclamation, "O-me-to-Fuh."
The solid rocks are engraven with Budhist titles, and
the whole island is under the spell of the almost talismanic
words, "O-me-to-Fuh."</p>

<p>Several of the temples are very extensive and highly ornamented,
although they begin to bear the marks of falling
greatness. At a distance they look very imposing; but on
nearer inspection, some of them are found to be more or less
tumbling to decay; in short, the priests are no longer wealthy,
and the visits of superstitious votaries to the island are less
numerous than formerly, and consequently the revenues have
diminished. There are few places, however, better worth
visiting by an inquiring traveller; and three or four days
could be spent upon the island with great pleasure and some
profit. The temples are gaudily ornamented, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
elegantly planned. You are struck with the succession of
shrines, one within the other, the huge gilded statues of
Budha, and the monstrous images by which they are surrounded
and attended. The temples are generally built in a
hollow, or at the bottom of a valley, so that the different
shrines or buildings of the principal monasteries rise one
above the other, being built on the declivity of the mountain's
side, which terminates in the valley. The yellow tiles of
some of them indicate former imperial protection. The most
picturesque sites have been chosen for them, and even caverns
in the rocks have in some parts been turned into a succession
of gilded temples.</p>

<p>There are good causeways leading to every part of the
island; on every crag there is either a temple or a little
image; the gardens are laid out with extreme care and neatness;
and were you not startled by the gross idolatry which
surrounds you, and repelled by the dull, vacant, half-idiotic
look of ignorant superstition stamped upon the countenance
of every man you meet, you might be almost tempted to
believe that it is a rich and happy,&mdash;a favoured and contented
spot. Some of the temples are very striking, and might be
called beautiful. In one of them was a very large library for
the use of the monks; but, as far as I could judge, the books
appeared to have been little, if at all used.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> There are three religions systems prevailing in China, and tolerated by the
government&mdash;viz., those of Confucius, of Laoutze, and of Budha. The two former
were contemporaries, and flourished about five hundred years before the Christian
era. That of Budha was introduced from India, very soon after the beginning of
our era, and gained such hold among the common people of China, that it is now
the general superstition of all the lower classes, and its showy temples and gilded
images abound throughout the land. Confucius, on the other hand, was simply a
political and moral philosopher, and in his temples no images are found; but he
was a politician, and was employed in the public service, <i>long before he became a
moralist</i>.
</p>
<p>
Laoutze was a contemplative enthusiast, who taught the cultivation of reason,
abstraction from the world, self-denial, &amp;c.; and then wandered into the absurdities
of magic arts and demoniac possessions. Nevertheless, he is said to have had
some glimmerings of a future state. His followers are in the present day called the
sect of Taou.
</p>
<p>
The Budhism of China probably differs little from that of India; the daily prayers
are repeated in a language of which the priests do not understand a syllable. In
the temple are the three huge Budhas&mdash;the Past, the Present, and the Future; with
a Goddess of Mercy, a God of War, a God of Wealth, and others. There is, in
front of the altar, a large bronze cauldron, for burning gilt paper; and a huge drum
and a bell, to awaken the especial attention of the god. Such are the temples of
Pooto.
</p>
<p>
In cases of extreme emergency, as during the prevalence of great drought and
threatened famine, the Emperor orders prayers to be offered up in the temples of all
the three sects, for a cessation of the evil. But the Confucian is the system of
religion to which the Emperor and his court adhere.</p></div></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>At the commencement of the month of May, 1842, it
became generally understood, that a movement was very soon
to be made upon Chapoo, which was to be followed by the
advance of the whole expedition up the great Yangtze river.
Ningpo, however, is deserving of one or two further observations,
for it is one of the most important trading cities in
China; and, from its position, and its vicinity to several large
and wealthy cities, such as Hang-chow-foo, Soo-chow-foo, and
others which border upon the Imperial Canal, there is every
reason to believe, that an extensive trade will soon be opened
there.</p>

<p>Ningpo lies at the distance of only fifty miles from the
trading town of Chapoo, which possesses a monopoly of the
whole trade with Japan and Corea. Hence there is reason to
believe, that our manufactures will soon find their way into
these latter countries, (which have hitherto excluded the
foreigner, more pertinaciously even than the Chinese,) indirectly
by way of Ningpo; and, that, in a few years, many
articles expressly adapted for the Japan market, will be ordered
to be manufactured in this country, and sent to Chinese merchants
at Ningpo. This city is famous for its silks, which are
very beautiful of their kind; and the shops are elegant, and
well supplied with all kinds of Chinese manufactures. It is a
wealthier and much handsomer town than Amoy, and is much
superior in commercial importance, to Foo-chow-foo, another
of the newly-opened ports. Large junks are even built on
the Ningpo river, and the people have always shewn a great
disposition to trade with foreigners. Indeed, this is the case
in every part of China where the people have not been held
back by their mandarins.</p>

<p>Mr. Gutzlaff, in one of his early voyages, obtained a list of
all the foreign ships which had formerly visited Ningpo, and
found their number to be considerable; and it was stated to
him that some of the very old people still retained a faint recollection
of the foreigners. The Portuguese traded at this
place in the sixteenth century, and the English had a factory
there as late as the middle of the last century. It was finally
pulled down in 1759, and all foreign trade was then absolutely
prohibited, by express orders from Pekin.</p>

<p>The principal objection made by the government at that
time to permit trade at Ningpo, was simply "the loss of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
imperial revenue, accruing from the overland carriage of tea
and other goods, to and from Canton." Add to this, the great
extortions of the local officers, who here, as well as at Chusan,
demanded such exorbitant fees and bribes, that it was found
impossible to carry on trade with any chance of profit.</p>

<p>It was at Ningpo that the Jesuit missionaries first set foot
in China; and thence, making their way to Pekin, succeeded,
by <i>good policy</i>, scientific acquirements, and conciliatory demeanour,
in winning the good-will of the people, and the
toleration of the government. This was towards the end of
the seventeenth century. For a time they possessed great
influence; and sanguine expectations were entertained of the
valuable results of their labours, and of the rich fruits which
would ripen to maturity, as soon as the tree of Christianity
which they planted in China, should spread its roots throughout
the land. Various causes conspired to produce their downfal
in China, principally connected with the political state of
Europe at that time. But it has been well observed by Sir
George Staunton, in his preface to the translation of the Penal
Code of China, that "the extinction of the order of Jesuits
in that country, caused the adoption of a plan of conversion
more <i>strict</i>, and probably more orthodox, but in the same
proportion, more unaccommodating to the prejudices of the
people, and more alarming to the jealousy of the government.
Generally speaking, it threw the profession <i>into less able hands</i>,
and the cause of Christianity and of Europe lost much of its
lustre and influence. The Jesuits were generally artists or
men of science, as well as religious teachers."</p>

<p>Ultimately, the teaching of Christianity at Pekin was strictly
prohibited, and particular objection was made to the printing
or translation of books into the <i>Chinese and Tartar languages</i>;
and, in 1805, all books of this kind were ordered to be seized
and destroyed, and the Tartar subjects were specially exhorted
to attend to the language of their own country, and the admonitions
of their own government; and, above all, to <i>practise
riding and archery</i>, and to study the works of the learned and
virtuous, and particularly to observe all the <i>social duties</i>.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, 1842, the city of Ningpo was given up,
it was impossible to spare a garrison for so large a city.
Neither was it any longer necessary to retain possession of it,
for the occupation of Chinhae at the river's mouth, would
command the whole trade of the city. Some of the principal
inhabitants, merchants, and others, were assembled by Sir
Hugh Gough, and into their hands the custody of the city was
given over, in the absence of all the constituted authorities.
As might be expected, our evacuation of Ningpo was represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
to the Emperor as a great victory gained. The Chinese
looked on in apparent astonishment, but there was no shouting
or expression of public feeling, and the gates were given over
to the persons selected for the purpose, who took possession
of them with a party of their followers, very little differing in
appearance from the common rabble. Our troops embarked
in perfect order on board the Queen, Sesostris, and Phlegethon,
and without any irregularity whatever.</p>

<p>The reinforcements which had already arrived in the Chinese
waters had not all yet joined the main body to the northward;
in fact, they did not leave Hong-Kong until a month afterwards,
but Sir Hugh Gough decided on proceeding to the
attack of Chapoo without waiting for them. All the troops,
however, which could possibly be spared from Chinhae,
Chusan, and Kolingsoo, (Amoy,) small garrisons only being
left at each of those places, had been called in, and the transports
were, therefore, tolerably crowded. The anchorage close
to the small island called Just-in-the-Way, lying nearly midway
between Chusan and Chinhae, was the appointed
rendezvous for the ships; and owing to various circumstances
they were unable to leave it before the 13th (May.)</p>

<p>The whole force which the General had now at his disposal,
exclusive of the naval brigade, was about two thousand two
hundred men, including the artillery and the gun lascars, and
sappers and miners. To this must be added about one hundred
and ten officers. The force was divided into three columns: the
right, composed of the 18th and 49th regiments, each being
from four to five hundred strong, together with a few sappers
and miners&mdash;in all about nine hundred and twenty men and
forty-eight officers&mdash;was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Morris. The centre, under Lieutenant-Colonel Montgomerie,
(Madras Artillery,) was composed of a small detachment of
the Royal Artillery, (twenty-five men only,) with the Madras
Artillery and Sappers, and the Madras Rifles, (one hundred
men,)&mdash;in all about four hundred and sixty men, (including
lascars,) and fifteen officers. And the left, composed of the
26th and 55th regiments, (the latter only half the strength of
the former,) together with twenty-five sappers, in all eight
hundred and twenty men, and two hundred and thirty officers,
was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Schoedde.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the ships of war, the Cornwallis, Blonde,
Modeste, Columbine, Starling, Algerine, and Plover, with the
troop-ship Jupiter, and several transports, got under weigh
with a light breeze; they soon passed the hill of Chinhae, (the
Pelican being at anchor in the river,) and afterwards neared
the Teshan Islands, and then, hauling up to the westward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
made the remarkable hills about Chapoo, and anchored in
seven and a half fathoms water, seventy-five miles from land.
Chapoo itself is in reality situated in what may be called an
open roadstead (with a shallow dry harbour close to the town)
on the northern side of the large deep bay, into which the
river which flows down past Hang-chow-foo, called the Tshen-tang
river, empties itself. The tides there are remarkably rapid
at all times; and on the following day a strong breeze setting
in from the north-east with hazy weather, it was impossible to
move from the anchorage. The next day there was still no
improvement in the appearance of the weather, and it was
not until the 16th that a reconnoissance of Chapoo could be
made by the General and Admiral on board the Phlegethon
and Nemesis steamers.</p>

<p>No information upon which reliance could be placed had
been obtained as to the actual strength of the Chinese force at
Chapoo, but the general belief was, either that a very large
body of troops would be found there, or that the place would
have been abandoned altogether by the enemy, for the purpose
of concentrating their forces for the protection of Hang-chow-foo.
This question was soon set at rest.</p>

<p>The view of Chapoo and the adjacent hills from the sea, as
you approach the coast, is very remarkable. The town and
its extensive suburbs are situated near the western extremity
of a small promontory, stretching east and west for the distance
of between four and five miles. The suburbs, which
appear to be the principal resort for merchants and traders,
and contain the most wealthy shops, run along the edge of
the beach, partly at the foot of the hills which rise up on
either side, and partly occupying a low flat between them.
The actual walled town stands about half a mile in the rear,
and the nature and extent of its defences could not be accurately
ascertained.</p>

<p>As the steamers were running in, so as to get near enough
to observe the nature of the Chinese defences, and the works
thrown up on the adjacent hills, a large fishing boat was
brought-to, to get information, and three of the fishermen,
being brought on board of the Nemesis, were questioned as
to the numbers of Chinese troops, &amp;c., on shore. One of
these men stoutly denied that there were any soldiers there at
all; but, upon a threat that they would all be hanged if they
were found to conceal the truth, the other two men declared
that there was a large force assembled for the defence of the
place.</p>

<p>On a nearer approach it was observed that there were three
principal hills extending along the coast to the eastward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the suburbs, for the distance of full three miles, and two or
three small islands lying off a little bay at their eastern extremity,
and contributing to shelter it, and to make it a good
landing-place for our troops. Upon the heights above,
several breastworks were thrown up, particularly along the
slopes between the hills. Upon the side of the hill nearest
the town were two small batteries, mounting five and seven
guns, and upon a low hill in front of the suburbs there was a
circular battery of twelve to fourteen guns. Along the shore,
a little further westward, a masked battery was commenced,
but apparently not yet completed. The steamers ran in close
enough to be able, with a glass, to observe the mandarins
despatching messengers along the heights, upon which a great
number of troops were posted, but they did not fire at the
steamers, although they came within range. Indeed, the
Chinese seemed disinclined to commence an action, and thus
provoke a contest.</p>

<p>The anchorage was completely surveyed by Commanders
Kellett and Collinson, who carefully sounded without any interruption
along the whole coast at night, thus enabling the
Cornwallis, Blonde, Modeste, and the other vessels before
named, to take up advantageous positions against the enemy's
works, and to cover the landing of the troops, which it was
decided should take place in the bay to the eastward, before
mentioned. From that point it appeared to the General that
the heights could be turned, and the enemy cut off before they
could make good their retreat upon the walled city.</p>

<p>At daylight, on the 17th, the whole of the men-of-war and
transports got under weigh, and stood in towards Chapoo, with
a light breeze from the southward, the Nemesis and Phlegethon
leading, and giving the soundings by signal to the Cornwallis,
the Algerine having dropped astern, owing to the light wind.
At eight, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, they came to anchor about four miles off shore,
it being nearly calm and high water. The positions had
already been assigned to the respective ships, and particularly
to the steamers, who were to land the troops. The fleet got
under weigh again soon after one o'clock, with a fresh breeze
from the south-west, and beat in towards the anchorage of
Chapoo, which they reached in the evening, when each ship
took up its allotted position without any obstacle. The
Nemesis anchored close in shore, in three fathoms water, and
from her deck every movement of the Chinese could be seen,
even without the aid of a glass. The transports were anchored
near the islands, off the little bay to the eastward, where the
troops were to land, under cover of the Starling, Columbine,
Plover, and Algerine. The Cornwallis and Blonde took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
positions against the small batteries upon the hill-side next
the suburbs, upon the top of which there was a temple, or
joss-house, occupied by a large body of the enemy, and the
Modeste was placed nearer the suburbs, to act against the
works in front. The Nemesis, Phlegethon, and Queen steamers
were in the first instance to land the troops from the transports,
assisted by the boats, while the Sesostris steamer was
anchored in shore, to shell the Chinese as they retreated before
our advancing troops.</p>

<p>The sun set clear and brilliant on that evening, the last
which many a brave man on both sides was doomed to look
upon. The Chinese were on the alert during the night, and
brought down some large ginjals, which they planted upon
the hill-side, abreast of the Nemesis, but did not make use
of them.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning the Nemesis went alongside the
transports, to take in the 18th Royal Irish, under Colonel
Tomlinson, and, having landed them in the appointed bay,
returned immediately to fetch part of the 55th, together with the
rifles; the remainder of the 55th, with the 26th, 49th, and
artillery, being landed by the Queen and Phlegethon, assisted
by the boats of the squadron, the whole under the direction of
Commander Charles Richards, of the Cornwallis. Sir Hugh
Gough landed with the first or right column from the Nemesis,
and at once occupied a height which commanded the landing-place,
without meeting with any opposition. As usual, the
Chinese had neglected their flanks, as if an enemy could only
think of attacking them where they were most prepared to
defend themselves.</p>

<p>As soon as the whole of the troops were formed, Colonel
Schoedde was directed to move with the 26th and 55th regiments,
forming the left column, and Colonel Montgomerie,
with the artillery and rifles, forming the centre, as rapidly as
possible round the base of the heights, in the rear of which
there was a broken valley, leading up in the direction of the
walled town, from which, by this means, the retreat of the
Chinese would be cut off. Sir Hugh Gough moved with the
left column, composed of the 18th and 49th regiments, under
Colonel Morris, along the crest of the heights, driving the
enemy before him from one point to another. As soon as the
advance was sounded in that quarter, the ships of war opened
fire upon the enemy's right flank, near the town, and after a
few rounds, the Chinese fled from their field works, and from
the joss-house upon the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>The Nemesis, in the meantime, having united her fire to
that of the other ships, was signalized to close the Cornwallis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
for the purpose of protecting the landing of the battalion of
seamen and marines under Captain Bourchier, who was accompanied
by the Admiral himself, who never shrunk from fatigue
or danger, ashore or afloat. The enemy's right flank was now
turned, and their principal works were fortunately carried
before the Chinese had time to spring the mines which they
had prepared. The enemy was soon in full flight.</p>

<p>The Sesostris threw some shells in upon the Chinese centre,
as our troops advanced upon them from their left; but, owing
to the rapid movement of the left column round the base of
the hills, and the dangerous direction of the line of fire of the
steamer, there was at one time more chance of danger to our
own men than to the Chinese. The sides of the hills were
covered with a great number of tombs, which, together with
the broken nature of the ground, afforded shelter and rallying
points for the enemy, behind which they occasionally made a
stand, and suffered severely in consequence. Many of the
Tartars were even seen deliberately cutting their own throats,
as our men were advancing upon them.</p>

<p>But the most terrible scene, and the point at which the
greatest loss on our side occurred, was a large house partly
enclosed with a wall, situated at the end of a little valley,
about a mile from the walls of the town. About three hundred
resolute Tartar soldiers, finding their retreat cut off, took
refuge in this building, determined to sell their lives as dearly
as possible, expecting no quarter from their enemy. The
defence of this large building was no part of their original
design; but as they were driven into it, one after another,
without any means of escape, they were forced to defend themselves.
The number who might be inside was not at first
known; and two small parties of the 18th and 49th, under
Lieutenant Murray, of the former corps, and Lieutenant and
Adjutant Browne, of the latter, attempted to follow them in,
but were unable to effect an entrance. Of the 49th party,
Lieutenants Browne and Mitchell were the only two who
escaped untouched. One man was killed and the rest
wounded.</p>

<p>This little check was now reported to Lieutenant-Colonel
Stevens of the 49th, who soon came up. Perceiving that
there were a great many of the enemy in the house, and that
they were firing from the windows and doors, he ordered our
troops to be withdrawn under cover, until the guns were
brought up. Colonel Tomlinson, of the 18th, having overheard
some injudicious remarks which he thought reflected
upon himself, instantly put himself at the head of a few of his
own regiment and of the 49th, and rushed in at the door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the joss-house. Scarcely a second had elapsed when he fell a
corpse into the arms of his men, having received two balls in
his neck. In fact, every man who attempted to enter was
either wounded or killed, as he became exposed to the steady
aim of the Tartars, in the narrow doorway, the light being full
upon him, while the Tartars were themselves concealed from
view.</p>

<p>The failure of this second attempt to enter the building,
added to the exasperation occasioned by the death of Colonel
Tomlinson, rendered it very difficult to restrain the men
from recklessly exposing themselves. Just at this time, one
6-pounder gun was brought up by Major Knowles, and some
rockets were also thrown into the house, but did not succeed
in setting it on fire. The field-piece made very little impression
upon the walls; but it was important that the place
should be destroyed and the Tartars captured. In the meantime,
it was blockaded by two companies of the 18th Royal
Irish.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Sir Hugh Gough had marched on
towards the city wall, and was joined there by Sir William
Parker with the naval brigade. As soon as the Admiral had
landed, Captain Hall, with three of his officers (including the
surgeon) and sixteen men, (eight seamen, and eight of the
Bombay artillery,) also landed as volunteers, and, after clearing
a hill in their front of some straggling Chinese soldiers,
they advanced directly up the hollow, at the extremity of
which stood the large building just mentioned. Already
Colonel Tomlinson was killed, and several other officers
wounded; both the rockets and the small field-piece had
failed to clear the house of its defenders. Captain Pears, the
field engineer, had also come up, and proposed to endeavour
to blow in a portion of the outer wall by means of a bag of
powder.</p>

<p>Seeing a small side-door open, Captain Hall, followed by
Lieutenant Fitzjames and one of his own men, got close to it
and fired into it, wounding a Tartar mandarin, but it was too
hazardous to try to force a passage in; and, as the defenders
kept up a smart fire from the windows above, it was necessary
to retire under cover. An attempt was then made to set fire
to the building, by throwing combustibles in at the principal
door; and Captain Hall rushed in towards it, with a bundle
of straw in one hand and his sword in the other, followed by
several of his men and one or two officers. Scarcely had he
reached the doorway, when a smart fire was opened from
within, by which two of his men were shot dead close by his
side, but he himself escaped as if by a miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>The bodies were instantly removed to a place of safety, and
this attempt failed, as the others had done. Three or four of
the Tartars now made an attempt to escape, by rushing out
of the doorway, and ran the gauntlet of ten or a dozen shots
directed at them. They ran for their lives and escaped,
although, from the traces of blood, it was thought that more
than one of them must have been wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Pears at length got a powder-bag fixed to the
northern wall of the building, which blew it in; and a small
party of the 18th again attempted to enter it, but one of them
was killed, and two wounded, and the rest withdrew. In fact,
it was so dark inside the building, and the space was so narrow,
that it was impossible to make a rush at it.</p>

<p>It was next proposed to set the place on fire, for on one
side the upper part of the building appeared to be built of
wood. Another powder-bag was fixed to that side of the
house, just below the wood-work, in the hope that it would
knock it all down together, or else set it on fire. The explosion
was so powerful that it not only destroyed part of the
wall, but brought down the wood-work above it, and thus
many of the Tartars above became exposed, of whom some
were shot, and others succeeded in getting down below. But,
wherever a Tartar shewed himself at a window in any part of
the building, several muskets were levelled at him; and, on
the other hand, so well did the Tartars take aim with their
matchlocks, that one of the Royal Irish, who <i>would</i> persist in
merely peeping round the doorway "just to see if he couldn't
pick off a Tartar," received a shot in his knee, before he had
himself time to fire.</p>

<p>The fragments of the wood-work, which had tumbled down,
were now collected into a heap by the sappers, and set on fire,
which soon communicated to the rest of the building. Gradually,
as it spread, the matchlocks of the Tartars (probably
of the fallen) were heard to go off, and loud cries were uttered.
The rest of the defenders must evidently surrender; and, on
entering the doorway, the poor fellows could now be seen
stripping off their clothes to avoid the flames, and running
about in despair from one side to the other. About fifty were
taken prisoners, but two or three, who tried to escape, were
shot; and so exasperated were the 18th at the loss of their
colonel, and some of their comrades, that it was not without
difficulty they were prevented from putting several of the
prisoners to death. These were now tied together by their
tails, in parties of eight or ten, so that they could not well
run away all together; and they were marched off, under an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
escort, to the walled town, which had already been taken possession
of.</p>

<p>The walls had been scaled near the east gate, by the grenadiers
of the 55th, without opposition; and the other gates of
the town were soon occupied by passing round the ramparts.
There were few guns, or even ginjals, mounted on them; and
the Chinese, having been once driven from the heights, and
cut off from the city, were dispersed all over the country, a
large body of them taking the direction of Hang-chow-foo.</p>

<p>Between Chapoo and that city there is a good canal communication,
supposed to be connected with the grand canal
itself; and, in addition to that, the communication by land,
along a good causeway, broad enough for artillery, gave many
facilities for an immediate advance upon the capital. It was
said also, that a curious Chinese map of the road, and of the
adjacent country had been obtained; but, with so small a
force, it was not thought advisable to march further inland.</p>

<p>If the loss of the Chinese was great on this day, so was it
on our side much greater than on any previous occasion. The
high spirit of the Tartar soldiers, the descendants of the conquerors
of China, and soldiers by birthright, could not brook
a total defeat; and, when they were further stimulated by the
excitement of opium, their self-devotion and stubbornness
tended to increase their loss. When they could no longer
fight, they could die; and the instances of mad self-destruction,
both within the city and without, were perfectly horrible.
Many of the Tartars were with difficulty prevented from cutting
their throats, which they attempted to do with apparent indifference.
On visiting the large building, or joss-house, which
had resisted so long, and had cost so many lives, a number of
dead and wounded men were found huddled together in a
horrible manner, in one of the out-buildings attached to it.
The ruins of the house were still smoking, and our object was
to drag out the wounded and put them under cover until they
could be properly attended to, for, on all occasions, the Chinese
wounded received every attention that could be shewn them
from our medical officers. Just as our men began to move
aside the dead bodies, a Tartar soldier, who had until now
concealed himself among them, literally rising from the dead,
stood up suddenly and drew his sword. But, instead of making
a dash for his life, or giving himself up as a prisoner, he
began deliberately to hack his own throat with the rusty
weapon, and inflicted two wounds upon himself before his
hand could be stopped. Another man was found concealed
in a deep hollow in the earth, where there was a sort of oven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
and could not be got out until some men were sent to dig him
out, and he was then found to be wounded. Altogether, the
scene at this house was quite enough by itself to appal any
man with the horrors of war. Many of the wounded were
dreadfully mutilated, and the dead bodies were charred and
disfigured.</p>

<p>A large building in the city was specially set apart for the
Chinese wounded, and the great kindness and attention they
received at Chapoo produced important effects afterwards upon
the authorities, and induced them to treat our prisoners with
kindness, instead of torturing them to death, as had frequently
been the case. The veteran Elepoo, who was, in fact, at that
time governor of Chapoo, (having been partially restored to
favour by the Emperor,) expressly thanked the General and
the Admiral for their humanity, in a letter written about a
month afterwards. "On inquiry," said he, "I found that you
gave the hungry rice to eat, and allowed to the wounded
medical attendance, and we feel obliged for your kindness and
courtesy." But this was not the only mark of their gratitude,
as we shall presently relate.</p>

<p>Too much praise cannot be given to the superintending
surgeon, Dr. French, (often mentioned in the despatches,)
and the other medical officers, for their constant attention to
the Chinese wounded, whenever they had an opportunity.
Occasionally, however, the Chinese refused all assistance.</p>

<p>Among the Tartar population, who were here for the first
time met with, living entirely separate from the Chinese, and
preserving their own habits and privileges, it is admitted by
all that the most shocking scenes were witnessed; and the
similar barbarities which were afterwards observed at the
Tartar city of Chin-keang-foo confirm all that has been said
of the cruel and revolting practices of that remarkable people
in time of war. All accounts concur in giving their testimony
to the fact of the self-destruction of whole Tartar families;
the women destroying their children, drowning them in wells,
and throwing themselves in afterwards; the husbands hanging
and poisoning their wives, and deliberately cutting their
own throats.</p>

<p>Every effort was made to put a stop to these barbarities,
and every means were used to pacify and soothe the people;
but as the greater part of the Tartar population had abandoned
the Tartar portion of the city, the Chinese rabble set about
plundering it, and frightened the few who remained, even
more than our own people.</p>

<p>The Tartar town, which was separated from the other by a
wall enclosing about one-fourth of the space within the city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
presented its peculiar aspect. The houses were disposed
something after the manner of tents in an encampment, one
of the last traces of the wandering pastoral habits of the race;
to each hut was attached a small bit of open ground, with a
bamboo fence round it, and a few trees within; and the vine
was not unfrequently seen twining itself among the bamboos.
Their scanty furniture was more rude than that of the Chinese;
and the bow, with its quiver full of arrows, the spear, the
sword, and the matchlock, seemed to be the most cherished
ornaments of their abode. <i>They</i> alone are permitted to retain
their weapons in their own charge. Indeed, the Tartar here
lives as a conqueror, and glories in the emblems of conquest
which he still has around him. In other respects, they are
all subject to the same laws, and wear the same dress, but
differ a good deal in their countenance and expression. Commonly
the Tartars are a fairer people than the Chinese, and
some of them much resemble Europeans.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that the conquerors imposed upon the
conquered the practice of shaving the head, excepting the
back part, with its long tail; but they themselves took care
never to adopt the absurd Chinese custom of preventing the
growth of the female foot, and even deforming it, in such a
way as to render it nearly useless to its owner. From the
Emperor's court to the lowest soldier's wife, no Tartar woman
ever has her foot tortured into deformity. At Chusan, I remember
seeing a Tartar woman walking about with her natural
undeformed feet, and she was looked at as a curiosity by the
Chinese inhabitants, who stared and smiled as if they thought
it a strange piece of barbarism.</p>

<p>The attention of children to their parents, for which the
Chinese as well as Tartars are remarkable, was shewn in many
instances, even amid the trials of war, at Chapoo. The aged
and infirm were of course unable to fly from the city, and many
of these were found in the Tartar houses, carefully tended by
their daughters, who stayed behind and braved the expected
horrors of an enemy's approach, rather than abandon an
aged parent. There were some touching scenes of this kind,
and when they found that they were not treated harshly, their
fears, which at first were distressing, gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>The country about Chapoo is perhaps one of the richest and
most beautifully cultivated spots in the world. It in some
respect resembles the prettiest parts of Devonshire. The
low hills immediately adjoining the town&mdash;the rich, luxuriant,
well-watered plain beyond, interspersed with numerous hamlets
and villages, with their curiously-shaped blue-tiled roofs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
intersected by canals and causeways, formed a very attractive
panorama, and served to indicate the means by which so dense
a population is supported. But even there the horrors of war
were still to be traced; dead bodies floating along the canals,
(probably of wounded who had been carried away and had died,)
parties of Chinese plunderers, hastening across the country,
laden with every kind of property, and, perhaps, occasionally,
a little, quiet European foraging party, hunting out ducks, and
fowls, and pigs, for which, however, the peasants were generally
very well paid.</p>

<p>It was not the object of Sir Hugh Gough to occupy the city
longer than was necessary for the purpose of destroying the
arsenals, and property belonging to the government, including,
of course, the iron guns, ginjals, &amp;c. The brass ones, some
of which were very good, were sent over to Chusan. Several
horses, or rather ponies, which had belonged to mandarins,
were captured by our officers, and one of these, a stout grey,
was carried up to Calcutta in the Nemesis, after the war was
over.</p>

<p>The number of Chinese engaged at Chapoo has been estimated
at between seven and eight thousand men, of whom
about one-fourth were Tartars. It is difficult to estimate the
number of their killed and wounded, but it must have been
very great; it has been estimated that nearly one-sixth of them
suffered more or less. On our side, two officers, one sergeant,
and ten men were killed, including three of the naval brigade,
of which two belonged to the Nemesis; six officers, one sergeant,
and about forty-five men were wounded, many of them
severely. The following were the names of the officers killed
and wounded: Killed&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel Tomlinson, 18th
Royal Irish, and Captain Colin Campbell, 55th regiment, died
two or three days after, from a severe wound in the head.
Wounded&mdash;Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Mountain, C.B., Deputy-Adjutant-General,
severely, (three balls in his back;) Lieutenant
A. E. Jodrell, 18th; Lieutenant A. Murray, 18th;
Captain T. S. Reynolds, 49th; Lieutenant and Adjutant
W. P. K. Browne, 49th; and Lieutenant J. G. Johnstone,
Madras Sappers and Miners.</p>

<p>There were ten brass guns taken, together with eighty-two
iron ones, and a number of ginjals, &amp;c.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>The results of the capture of Chapoo, and of the total defeat
of the best troops the Chinese had yet brought against
us, were very remarkable. On the one hand, the people
more than ever dreaded our power, while they also wondered
at our forbearance; and, on the other hand, the tone of the
government began evidently to change, and overtures were
now made (probably with a view to gain time) to induce our
military and naval commanders-in-chief to suspend hostilities.
Advances of a similar kind had been made at Chinhae,
but did not appear to be founded upon sufficient authority to
permit them to be entertained. They were renewed at
Chapoo, but in an equally unsatisfactory manner, and the
agent of the Chinese on both occasions, and also on subsequent
ones, was a mandarin of low degree, the very sending
of whom was sufficient to point out that their object was merely
to sound our disposition, and blind our credulity.</p>

<p>At Hang-chow-foo the people were so much alarmed that
they openly expressed their dissatisfaction to the High Imperial
Commissioner Yih-king, who was also generalissimo of
the forces, a member of the imperial cabinet, and a relation
of the Emperor. But above all, the generous treatment of
the Chinese prisoners by the orders of Sir Hugh Gough, the
attention shewn to their wounded, and their being at last all
given up before our forces left Chapoo, <i>each of them receiving
a present of money</i>, (about three dollars for each man,) all
these humane proceedings together produced a most powerful
impression upon all classes of the Chinese.</p>

<p>When the Chinese prisoners were sent back from Chapoo,
a letter was at the same time addressed to Elepoo,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in reply
to the overtures which had been made. It was to the effect,
"that hostilities could not be suspended until the Chinese
government were disposed to negotiate on the terms offered
by the British government, through the medium of her
majesty's plenipotentiary, who was then daily expected at
Chusan."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>
<p>Elepoo was determined not to be outdone in courtesy, and
before our fleet entered the Yangtze river, he sent a very
important and remarkable letter, addressed to our commanders-in-chief,
styling them the "Honourable General and Admiral."
He talked a great deal about good faith and sincerity, and
thanked them for sending back the prisoners, and for the
attention and kindness shewn to the wounded. He proceeded
to inform them, that he had in return sent back all <i>our</i> prisoners
to Chapoo, who had been previously kept at Hang-chow-foo;
but that on their arrival there, it was found that
the fleet had already sailed, in consequence of which they
were obliged to be taken back. He further added, "that he
was desirous to negotiate and make arrangements, in order to
protect <i>the lives of the people of both countries</i>."</p>

<p>Neither the prisoners nor the letter were, however, received
for some time afterwards. By Elepoo's orders, <i>thirty dollars
were afterwards paid to every white man, and fifteen dollars
to every native of India, or, as they call them, to every "black
man;"</i> thereby marking their sense of the distinction between
them. Altogether, there were sixteen prisoners restored by
the Chinese, two of whom belonged to the Nemesis, one being
an English seaman, the other a negro lad, who had been a
slave at Macao, but had escaped and came on board the
Nemesis, where he turned out a very smart, useful lad. They
had been kidnapped at Chusan, and thence carried over to the
mainland.</p>

<p>After having been brought back to Hang-chow-foo, from
Chapoo, the prisoners remained there five days, and were well
fed and taken care of. They were then put into sedan chairs,
and carried through the whole Chinese army encamped to the
southward of that city. The camp appeared to be of immense
extent, and full of soldiers, who crowded round the sedan
chairs with eager curiosity, but without attempting to offer
any violence. They appeared particularly amused at the
appearance of the black men. It was remarked, that about
one in ten of the soldiers was armed with a matchlock, the
rest having only spears, swords, and bows and arrows, the
latter of which they seemed to be most proud of. The
danger they ran of having their clothes set on fire by the
match, particularly when wounded, or by the ignition of the
powder, always made them more or less afraid of arming themselves
with the matchlock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>After travelling for several days, partly in sedans and partly
along canals, during which they passed a large town, called
Chow-king, apparently as large as the capital itself, the prisoners
arrived at Yuyow, on the 11th of June, whence they
were conveyed to Ningpo, and after a very short halt, proceeded
down the river to Chinhai, where they were most joyfully
received on board H.M. brig Pelican, by Capt. Napier.</p>

<p>Communications subsequently took place between Elepoo
and our military and naval commanders-in-chief. In one of
these Elepoo says, that he is surprised to learn that the fleet
of our "<i>honourable country</i> had sailed up the Woosung river,
firing guns and stirring up a quarrel; and then expresses his
regret that the war had already lasted so long, and that many
lives had been lost, and unspeakable misery produced. Is it
not far better to enjoy the blessings of peace than to fight for
successive years, and to fill the land with the bodies of the
slain?" This, however, was merely an attempt to lull the
activity of our commanders, and to delay their measures by
pretence of negotiation.</p>

<p>The reply of Sir Hugh Gough and Sir William Parker was
characteristic&mdash;namely, "that they were thankful to Elepoo
for having sent back the British subjects who were prisoners,
and begged to assure him that they gladly recognised in this act
the good feeling which should always subsist between civilized
nations. In respect to the other letter they added, that
with the utmost desire to lessen the calamities of war, it was
their duty to proceed with hostilities until they were assured
that a functionary, <i>duly authorized</i> by his Imperial Majesty,
should be prepared to negotiate a peace, and to meet those
just demands which had been repeatedly submitted to his
Imperial Majesty. With every respect for his exalted position
and acknowledged probity, the high British officers must
remind his excellency, that they have not yet been apprized
that he is <i>authorized to treat</i>, on the conditions promulgated
by the British government."</p>

<p>The high tone of these letters must have rather surprised
both the veteran Elepoo and the imperial cabinet. They had
been so long accustomed to communicate with foreigners only
through inferior agents, that they could hardly bring themselves
on a sudden to adopt the practice of conducting negotiations
upon a footing of perfect equality. The ingenious
expedient was therefore resorted to of sending to Canton to
order up some of the Hong merchants to act as mediators.
The aged Howqua excused himself on account of his infirmities,
but sent his only surviving son in his place, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
by Samqua, another Hong merchant of repute, and
two linguists.</p>

<p>The journey from Canton to the province of Che-keang, or
rather to that part of it in which their services might be
required, Hang-chow-foo, or Soo-chow-foo, a distance of
upwards of six hundred geographical miles, was no pleasing
task in the middle of summer, particularly in a country where
the only mode of travelling is in sedan chairs. However, they
were compelled to go, but were speedily sent back again without
having been permitted to hold any communication whatever
with any of our high officers. Indeed, Sir Henry Pottinger
had long before so positively refused to receive both
the Hong merchants and the Prefect of Canton, that it is surprising
how any further expectation could have been formed
that their services would be required.</p>

<p>While speaking of the Hong merchants, it is worth mentioning,
that about this time notice was sent by the aged
Howqua to the foreign residents at Canton, that there was
reason to believe that some of the wells had been poisoned,
and that there were vendors of poisoned provisions about the
streets. If this report was true, the diabolical purpose was
thus frustrated, and no bad results followed.</p>

<p>We must now return to the operations of our forces, subsequently
to the capture of Chapoo. Fortunately the health of
the troops had been good during their ten days' stay on shore,
so that nearly the whole force was in a condition to take part
in the projected operations in the Yangtze river. Lieutenant-Colonel
Tomlinson, whose death was so much lamented by all
his brother officers, was buried at sea soon after Chapoo was
taken, being carried out in the Phlegethon, as it was feared
that if a grave were dug for him on shore, his remains might
be taken up by the Chinese, and a great boast made of their
having killed one of the high English officers.</p>

<p>On the 27th May, a great part of the troops were embarked
on board the different transports, and the remainder on the
following morning, when the whole fleet got under weigh.
On the 29th, they anchored in a safe and extensive sound,
which had been discovered by Captains Kellett and Collinson,
at the Rugged Islands, about forty miles to the eastward of
Chapoo. Some days were spent at this anchorage, in order
that a proper channel into the Yangtze river for large vessels
might be carefully examined. During this interval, the Admiral
took an opportunity of revisiting Chusan, in the H.C.
steamer Pluto, which had just arrived from England, together
with the small iron steamer Ariadne, from Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 5th June, the whole fleet stood up towards the
entrance of the river, but their progress was much delayed by
the great strength of the tides, and also by fogs, so that they
did not reach the appointed rendezvous off the Amherst
rocks, (a little to the eastward of the mouth of the river,)
until the 8th, having always been obliged to anchor at night.</p>

<p>A further delay now occurred, while the Modeste, with the
Nemesis and Pluto steamers, were detached to intercept the
communications up the river, and to reconnoitre the defences
of Woosung. A large fleet of trading junks was soon espied
near the latter place, and the Nemesis was ordered to give
chase, and bring them to. She very soon got ahead of them,
and cut them off, obliging them to anchor immediately. Some,
however, persisted in holding their course, until several shots
had been fired across their bows. The junkmen appeared
terribly frightened, although Mr. Gutzlaff, who was on board
the Nemesis, assured them that they would receive no injury,
and would be allowed to depart again, as soon as their cargoes
had been examined.</p>

<p>A great number of junks were found laden with the most
beautiful fish, very carefully packed in ice, probably destined
for Nankin, and for places along the imperial canal; but it is
remarkable that none of these cargoes were fallen in with
afterwards, higher up the river; which tended to prove that
there were innumerable canals by which they could convey
their produce into the interior, without proceeding up the
main river beyond a certain point, thereby avoiding the delays
occasioned by the currents, and the dangers of the navigation.
This excellent opportunity of getting well supplied with fish
and ice was not allowed to pass unheeded, but none of the
junks were detained beyond a few hours. <i>One</i> junk, however,
was always kept back, until another made its appearance; but,
as it was impossible for strangers to distinguish at a distance
the <i>kind</i> of junks which were loaded with such a welcome
cargo, every captain was made to understand that he would
have to supply fish and ice for the use of the steamer, until
he could point out another junk coming up the river with a
similar cargo, which was then to take his place, and he was to
be liberated. In this way, one continued to succeed the
other. This hint was quite sufficient to put the fellows in
excellent humour. It was curious to observe what a sharp
look-out they kept, frequently climbing up to the mast-head
to see if their longed-for substitute was approaching. The
one who last arrived soon reconciled himself to this fate very
good-naturedly, when informed by his predecessor that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
great harm would be done to him. They all, however, seemed
very glad to get away, the moment permission was given to
them, and refused all kind of payment when offered. Fresh
fish of the best quality, and plenty of ice to cool the wine and
beer, were unexpected luxuries.</p>

<p>At Woosung, Captain Watson, with the Modeste, which was
anchored just out of range of the batteries, was occupied for
several days in sounding the channel, and was assisted in this
duty by the Pluto, under Lieutenant Tudor. They were
ordered to reconnoitre the mouth of the Woosung river,
(which empties itself into the Yangtze, about twenty-five miles
up its southern branch,) preparatory to the grand attack upon
the batteries.</p>

<p>The night of the 11th of June was particularly dark and
rainy, and the opportunity appeared singularly favourable for
making a close reconnoissance of the batteries. The Modeste
lay some way off shore, and the tide was running so strong
that it was impossible for Captain Hall, who had anchored
the Nemesis much nearer in, to communicate with his senior
officer, Captain Watson, concerning the plan which he proposed
for reconnoitring the batteries. About two hours before
midnight, the cutter of the Nemesis was ordered away,
manned and armed, to make a close examination of the batteries,
and of the channel leading into the Woosung river,
which the former were principally designed to protect.</p>

<p>Having carefully sounded the channel, Captain Hall boldly
pushed in as quietly as possible, towards the front of the
batteries; and being favoured by the boisterous weather, he
landed on the beach without being discovered. He could now
distinguish the Chinese sentry quite near him; and on looking
through one of the embrasures he could see one of the military
mandarins on duty, going his rounds along the battery,
attended by two armed soldiers, one of whom carried a large
paper lantern before him, which threw a strong light in his
face, and prevented him of course from seeing objects, even at
a very short distance from him. It was evident, therefore,
that the Chinese were upon the alert; though it would have
been very easy, with the help of the boat's crew, to have made
prisoners both of the mandarin and two soldiers, before the
alarm could have been given.</p>

<p>After three hours' examination, and a heavy pull against the
rapid current which prevails there, the boat of the Nemesis
got back to the vessel; and on the following day she rejoined
the Admiral off the Amherst rocks. It was about this time
that the little Ariadne steamer, having been sent to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the exact position of a rock lying off the mouth of the Yangtze,
unfortunately ran directly upon it, and was bilged. A sail
was immediately passed under her bottom, to cover the leak,
and she was towed by the Sesostris into Chusan harbour,
where, owing to some unforeseen accident, she afterwards went
down in deep water, and all attempts to get her up again failed.</p>

<p>On the 13th, Sir William Parker, in the Cornwallis, accompanied
by the Blonde, Columbine, Jupiter troop-ship, and the
Phlegethon, Tenasserim, and Medusa steamers, together with
twelve transports, got under weigh from the anchorage off
Amherst rocks, and succeeded in reaching the mouth of the
Woosung river, without any accident whatever. The Clio,
Bentinck, (since called Plover,) Starling, and two transports,
had been stationed as beacon-vessels, to mark the proper
channel, which, however, was so shallow, that for a part of the
distance there was little more water (only a few feet) than the
actual draught of the Cornwallis.</p>

<p>On the following day, the Admiral and the General proceeded
in the Medusa steamer, the smallest which was under
his command since the loss of the Ariadne, and jocularly
christened the Pilot Fish, to make a close reconnoissance of
the whole line of defences extending along both sides of the
Woosung river.</p>

<p>It is here necessary to bear in mind the relative position of
the Woosung river in respect to the Yangtze, in order to avoid
confusion in reading the account of the operations. The
former empties itself into the latter on its right bank, and the
village or small town of Woosung, which contains nearly five
hundred houses, stands at its mouth. This place was visited
by Mr. Medhurst, during his missionary tour up the coast of
China in 1835, and the people were there found to be remarkably
civil and well disposed.</p>

<p>The breadth of the river at its entrance may be about a mile,
but the channel for vessels of moderate burden is somewhat
intricate, and scarcely more than three hundred yards wide.
The course of the river runs nearly north and south, and,
as it joins the great Yangtze, its banks gradually widen
out, until they are soon lost in the banks of the larger river.
The principal line of defence was situated along its western
bank, running from the upper end of the village of Woosung
for a distance of full three miles along the river's mouth, and
curving gradually round towards the banks of Yangtze river.</p>

<p>The town of Paoushan is situated nearly two miles in the
rear of the batteries at that end. This long line of embrasures
mounted not less than one hundred and thirty-four guns; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
they were generally a great deal too wide, and the battery was
constructed of earth, very much like the works already described
at Chusan. Stakes were driven in along the front to
protect it from the sudden landing of troops, and probably to
secure the banks from the effects of inundations.</p>

<p>Just above the village of Woosung, and skirting it on its
southern side, was a large creek or canal, communicating with
the river, and protected by a strong semicircular stone battery,
regularly built, and mounting ten brass 24-pounder guns.
From its position it served to defend the river itself, for it
commanded the whole reach, as well as the mouth of the
creek.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the river, opposite Woosung, stood a
strong fort, principally built of brick, nearly of a circular form,
and from its elevation calculated to have a long range. It was
flanked by a line of embankments, with embrasures not yet
completed, but mounting altogether twenty-one guns. There
were one hundred and seventy-five guns mounted for the defence
of Woosung. But it was not the number of guns which
constituted the strength of its defences. The choicest Tartar
troops had been collected at this point, who were prepared to
defend it obstinately. They worked their guns with great
spirit, and kept up a better sustained fire than they had done
on any previous occasion; and when their principal line of
battery was turned by the movement of a body of seamen and
marines upon their flank, they defended themselves with remarkable
obstinacy and courage, and did not hesitate to
measure the sword with the cutlass, or to cross the spear with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>There was some difficulty in finding a spot where troops
could be disembarked with a view to turn the position, for the
water shoaled to three feet, within two hundred yards of the
banks, and the disembarkation could only be effected under
cover of the guns of our ships.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th, both the tide and the state of
the weather being favourable, the Admiral determined that the
attack should be made without further delay, and ordered that
the ships should be towed into action by the steamers, so that
they would be enabled to take up the precise positions allotted
to them. There were five steamers ready for the service,
besides the little Medusa, which was reserved to meet any unforeseen
contingency. It was the first action in which the
ships of war were <i>all</i> towed into their appointed stations. The
little Algerine was the only exception, as she was directed to
get in as near as possible under sail. Even the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Star, Captain Sir E. Home, which only came in sight just
as the action had already commenced, was towed in by the
Tenasserim, which, after placing the Blonde in her proper
position, was sent out on purpose to fetch her.</p>

<p>The Cornwallis and Blonde, being the two heaviest ships,
were to take up their positions in front of the batteries, just
below the village of Woosung, and the light squadron was
then to pass them and proceed up the river to attack the
village, and the battery at the mouth of the creek above it, and
also the circular battery on the opposite or east side of the
river. The light squadron consisted of the Modeste, Columbine,
and Clio, towed respectively by the Nemesis, Phlegethon,
and Pluto.</p>

<p>The channel had been buoyed off the previous night, and
two junks had been moored so as to mark the entrance, on the
eastern side of which there ran out a long sand-bank.</p>

<p>At the dawn of day on the 16th all the ships of war got
under weigh, and by six o'clock they were in tow of their
respective steamers. In this instance, and indeed throughout
all the operations in the north of China, under Sir William
Parker, the steamers were always lashed <i>alongside</i> the vessels
they had to tow, instead of going ahead. This plan was found to
answer remarkably well in the intricate navigation of the
Yangtze river, as the movements of both vessels were more
easily managed. The Blonde, towed by the Tenasserim, led
in towards the batteries; the Cornwallis followed, bearing the
Admiral's flag, and lashed alongside of the Sesostris. This
post of honour was assigned to the Blonde, because, as soon as
the light squadron had passed up the Woosung, she would
have been nearer at hand to support them, if necessary.</p>

<p>The Blonde and Cornwallis received the fire of the Chinese,
which was opened with great spirit, without returning a shot,
until they had anchored by the stern in excellent positions.
The light squadron then passed them, except the little
Algerine, which could not follow the rest under sail, and
therefore brought up a little astern of the Admiral's ship.</p>

<p>The Modeste, under Captain Watson, who commanded the
light squadron, was towed by the Nemesis up the river in
gallant style, boldly dashing in towards the creek above the
village of Woosung, and receiving a severe and well-directed
fire from the whole line of batteries, but more particularly from
the battery of ten brass guns situated at the corner of the
creek, the approach to which, as before described, it commanded.
Both of these vessels suffered a good deal in executing
this bold man&oelig;uvre; and in order to shelter the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
they were all ordered by Captain Hall to lie down at quarters,
on board the Nemesis, until the Modeste had been placed in
a good position. The fire of the Chinese was severe and well
directed, and the Nemesis suffered a good deed as well as the
Modeste.</p>

<p>Some way further up the river, fourteen war-junks were in
sight, and also five large newly-built wheel-boats, each moved
by <i>four wooden paddle-wheels</i>. These vessels also opened
fire, but at such a distance that their shot fell short. The
Columbine, towed by the Phlegethon, and the Clio by the Pluto,
followed their gallant leader up the river towards the creek.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the North Star was observed just coming
up towards the mouth of the river, and the Tenasserim steamer,
which had just cast off the Blonde, was now sent out to tow
her into action, and she was placed just ahead of the Blonde.</p>

<p>The Nemesis cast off the Modeste as soon as she had carried
her up to the mouth of the creek, and within musket-shot
of the ten gun-battery, and then opened fire with her
foremost gun upon the war-junks, and with her after-gun
upon the battery itself. The junks returned the fire as the
Nemesis advanced towards them, but the moment she came
within range of grape and canister, the Chinese Commodore,
or Admiral, set the example of running away, which all the
rest were glad enough to follow. They now made for the
shore the best way they could, each trying which could reach it
the quickest, but the wheel-boats had a decided advantage, and
were moved through the water at the rate of about three and a
half knots an hour. Grape and canister were now poured into
them as fast as the guns could be loaded. The confusion
among the Chinese sailors was great: some took to their
boats or sampans, others jumped overboard, and tried to swim
ashore, and a few of these must have been drowned.</p>

<p>The wheel-boats were, as a matter of curiosity, the first
boarded, and it was afterwards ascertained that they were each
commanded by a mandarin of high rank: which marks the
importance they gave to them. These wheel-junks were fitted
with two paddle-wheels on either side, strongly constructed of
wood. The shaft, which was also of wood, had a number of
strong wooden cogs upon it, and was turned by means of a
capstan, fitted also with cogs, and worked round by men.
The machinery was all below, between decks, so that the men
were under cover. They were all quite newly-built, and
carried some two, some three, newly-cast brass guns, besides
a number of large ginjals. A quantity of matchlocks, spears,
swords, &amp;c., were also found on board.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuing two of the largest junks too close in shore, the
Nemesis took the ground when the tide was falling. The
Phlegethon came up at this time, and tried to tow her off,
but without success, and she, therefore, stuck fast for some
hours. But the boats were sent away manned and armed
under Mr. Galbraith, with orders to capture and destroy the
rest of the junks which were floating about the river, deserted
by their crews. Other boats were sent to destroy those which
had been run ashore, but it was seen from the mast-head that
the Chinese were lying in wait to cut them off among the
scattered trees and buildings by the river side; and they
were, therefore, ordered not to go out of gun-shot from the
steamer.</p>

<p>The Phlegethon, under Lieutenant M'Cleverty, took part
in the destruction of the junks, and out of the whole fleet only
two war-junks escaped. Three wheel-boats and one junk
were afterwards towed down the river to the fleet, but the rest
were set on fire and destroyed.</p>

<p>To return to the advanced squadron. As soon as the
Modeste was cast off from the Nemesis, sail was made, and
she was carried alongside a wharf or small jetty within the
creek, close to the village of Woosung. The ten-gun battery
opposite kept up its fire upon her, but, under cover of a
broadside, the Modeste was made fast to the jetty. In this
position she soon silenced the fort with her larboard-guns and
small arms, and received little damage from the fire of the
enemy, because they could not depress their guns enough to
bear upon her with effect, so close was she.</p>

<p>The pinnace was now sent ashore, manned and armed, to
take possession of the fort, and there was some skirmishing
with the rear-guard of the Chinese who were retreating. Mr.
Birch, with a party of seamen, was at the same time ordered
to spike the guns; and at this moment the Columbine, followed
by the Pluto steamer, came up, and poured in a well-directed
fire upon the column of the retreating enemy.</p>

<p>During all this time, the Cornwallis, Blonde, and North
Star were hotly engaged with the batteries, abreast of which
they were anchored, and soon made the Chinese slacken their
fire. Perceiving this, Captain Watson boldly determined to
land, with the marines and small-arm men of the Modeste,
Columbine, and Clio, within the creek, in the hope of being
able to turn the enemy's flank next the village, and also cut
off their retreat. A body of the Chinese were observed lying
down under cover of the embankment, apparently in readiness
to meet their enemy. Captain Watson now formed his men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
and gallantly dashed on towards the Chinese, but had to cross
a deep canal, over which there were several small wooden
bridges, in the rear of the works.</p>

<p>The Chinese received them with a heavy fire of matchlocks
and ginjals, but gradually retreated as Captain Watson advanced,
and fell back upon their main body, who now shewed
a most determined front, and deliberately planted their ginjals
directly in the only path by which they could be approached.
Captain Watson had already ten of his men wounded; and,
finding his party getting a little straggled, he drew them outside
of the line of embankment, in order to form them again.
The Chinese now came boldly out, brandishing their spears
in defiance; and threw a volley of hand grenades, which went
over their heads.</p>

<p>At this moment, Captain Bourchier, seeing Captain Watson's
party hotly engaged with the Chinese, who were much
their superiors in numbers, dashed on shore from the Blonde,
directly in front of the battery; and at the same moment
Captain Watson's party made a rush at the enemy, who stood
their ground so firmly, that for the second time the spear and
the bayonet were crossed, and no one who witnessed the
obstinacy and determination with which the Chinese defended
themselves could refuse them full credit for personal bravery.
They were now driven back under cover of some houses,
where they rallied.</p>

<p>By this time the marines and seamen of the Blonde and
Cornwallis were landed nearly opposite those vessels, under
Captain Bourchier, Captain Peter Richards, and Sir Everard
Home, and joined Captain Watson. Sir William Parker also
landed; and, as soon as the men were all formed, they succeeded
in driving the enemy out of the whole line of batteries.
A small party from the Algerine, under Lieutenant Maitland,
boldly landed before they could be well supported, and were a
little cut up.</p>

<p>The Sesostris in the meantime had been closely engaged
with the strong fort on the eastern side of the entrance of the
river, where she took the ground in such a position that she
was able to bring her guns to bear, so as soon to silence the
enemy, when Captain Ormsby landed at the head of a body of
small-arm men from the Sesostris and Tenasserim, and took
possession of the fort.</p>

<p>The troops were not landed in time to take any part in the
engagement, for most of the steamers had taken the ground,
and it was not until past twelve o'clock that there were any
means of putting the troops ashore. Sir Hugh Gough then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
landed just opposite the Cornwallis, and determined to advance
immediately upon the town of Paoushan in the rear, towards
which it was understood a large body of the Chinese had
fled, together with the governor of the provinces. Major-General
Schoedde was now ordered to move forward, so as to
get in the rear of the town, in hopes of cutting off the enemy
who might be retreating in that direction; while Sir Hugh
Gough, with the rest of the force, reinforced by the naval
brigade, moved along the river batteries.</p>

<p>On reaching Paoushan, it was found already in the possession
of Major-General Schoedde's brigade, which had entered
it without opposition; the soldiers and a great part of the
inhabitants flying out of it in great consternation. The walls
of the town were not found to be in very good repair, but they
mounted about fifty guns, of which seventeen were brass.
The main body of the Chinese were ascertained to have fled
in the direction of Soo-chow-foo.</p>

<p>The number of killed and wounded, on the Chinese side,
was less than might have been expected, probably not exceeding
altogether a couple of hundred; but among them was the
commander-in-chief of the Chinese troops. On our side, one
officer (Lieutenant Hewitt, R.M.) and one seaman, were
killed; and among the wounded were Mr. Purvis, midshipman
of the Blonde; Mr. A. J. Smith, mate, and Mr. Roberts,
master of the Sesostris; together with fifteen seamen, one
corporal, and five royal marines, and one Bombay artilleryman,
most of them severely, and several dangerously.</p>

<p>Many large and well-made guns were captured, particularly
some newly-cast brass guns, of great length. Some of the
best and heaviest guns were mounted upon the ten-gun fort,
at the point of the creek where the Modeste was so hotly
engaged. But the greater part of the guns were of small
calibre, and about one-half of the whole number captured were
6-pounders, or under. The largest were 24-pounders, and
there were a good many varying from 10 to 18-pounders.
About two hundred and fifty guns were captured altogether,
including those taken at Paoushan; of these, forty-two were
brass.</p>

<p>There was one very curious iron gun, of a peculiar shape,
being very small at the muzzle, and very large from the middle
to the breach. It was of Chinese casting, and had an inscription
on it, which shewed that it was upwards of three hundred
years old. There was also another curious old gun, with the
arms of Spain upon it. Besides the above, a number of large
ginjals and matchlocks, together with military stores of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
kinds, were discovered and destroyed; and to these must also
be added the guns destroyed in the war-junks.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese were not prepared to expect the complete
defeat they sustained at Woosung. The great extent of their
preparations for defence, the determined resistance they offered,
and the improvements they had adopted in the form and
casting of their guns, and in the construction of their junks,
sufficiently indicate the importance which they attached to
the defence of this position. Precisely in proportion to their
previous expectations were the disappointment and panic produced
by their defeat.</p>

<p>Information was obtained, through Mr. Gutzlaff, that the
Chinese were removing their property and families from the
important commercial town of Shanghai, situated about fourteen
miles up the Woosung river; from which place it was
known that there was very extensive water-communication with
some of the most important districts and cities of China.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost in taking advantage of the prevailing
panic; and, accordingly, on the day after the capture of Woosung,
the Nemesis and Medusa steamers were sent up, with
Captain Kellett on board, for the purpose of sounding the
channel, and to ascertain what defences the Chinese had constructed
higher up. The deepest channel was found to run
along the left bank for about two miles, and then to cross
over towards the right bank, by keeping which on board there
was water enough for a frigate at half-flood.</p>

<p>About seven miles up, they came in sight of two forts, one
on either side of the river. One of these fired off all its guns
at the two steamers, but the shot fell far short. Soon afterwards
a blaze was seen to burst out in each of the forts, and,
on inquiry, it was found that the Chinese had set the buildings
on fire, and then abandoned the works. Being ordered not
to proceed further than this point, the two steamers rejoined
the Admiral, in order to report the result of the reconnoissance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>
<p>The same afternoon, the Modeste, Columbine, and Clio,
towed as before by the Nemesis, Phlegethon, and Pluto, were
sent up the river, under the command of Captain Watson, with
orders to place them near the two batteries, but out of their
range, and then to land and destroy the guns, if the Chinese
were found to have abandoned them.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, these orders were skilfully
executed; but the Clio unfortunately grounded, and, as the
tide was falling, could not be towed off. Captain Watson
landed with the marines and small-arm men of the Modeste
and Columbine, and took possession of the forts which had
been abandoned. In the larger fort on the right bank were
found forty-one guns, eight of which were brass, and, in the
opposite fort, fourteen guns, of which likewise eight were
brass, or, more properly speaking, of copper. Many of these
were found dismounted, and the carriages taken away. The
tents and buildings had been already destroyed. Higher up
the river eight war-junks were discovered, which were set on
fire and destroyed, except one, in which the copper guns,
captured in the forts, were put on board and sent down the
river.</p>

<p>Reinforcements had now arrived to join both arms of the
expedition, but were just too late to take part in the action at
Woosung. H.M.S. Dido, Honourable Captain Keppell,
arrived the very evening after the engagement; and, on the
next day, the 2nd regiment Madras Native Infantry, and
detachments of Artillery, with Sappers and Miners, also joined
the forces under Sir Hugh Gough.</p>

<p>The 19th was the day fixed for the capture of Shanghai, for
which purpose one column of our troops was to march by land,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Montgomerie, M.A., consisting of
about one thousand men, including the 18th and 49th
regiments, with detachments of the Madras horse artillery
and the royal artillery, with Sappers and Miners. The rest
of the troops were embarked in the Tenasserim, Nemesis,
Phlegethon, and Pluto steamers, which took in tow respectively
the North Star, Modeste, Columbine, and Clio.
The marines of the squadron were also taken up in the little
Medusa; and Sir William Parker and Sir Hugh Gough, with
their staff, accompanied by Captains Bourchier, Richards,
Keppel, and other officers, proceeded up the river in that vessel.</p>

<p>They passed the deserted batteries, and met with no opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
until they came within sight of the city, where a long,
well-constructed battery, situated below the town on the same
or the left bank of the river, opened fire on the North Star
and the other vessels, as they approached, but at such a distance
as to do no damage. A couple of broadsides from the
North Star and Modeste, with a few shot from the Tenasserim
and Nemesis, sufficed to drive the Chinese out of the works.
Captain Bourchier, with the seamen and marines, immediately
landed and took possession of the battery, upon which no less
than forty-nine guns were found mounted, seventeen of which
were of copper.</p>

<p>The steamers conveying the troops soon reached the city of
Shanghai, where the 55th regiment was landed from the
Nemesis, upon a small jetty, without the necessity of using
boats; another instance of the great utility of flat-bottomed,
iron steamers. The city had been already taken possession of
by the column under Colonel Montgomerie, without resistance,
and many of the respectable inhabitants were hurrying off in
great consternation, while the low rabble had, as usual, commenced
their work of robbery and destruction the moment the
authorities left the place.</p>

<p>Colonel Montgomerie's column had met with no opposition
during its advance, and but little difficulty, except occasionally
in crossing the guns over the narrow water-courses. They
passed close in the rear of the fort which had opened on the
ships, without seeing it; but, upon hearing the firing, they
hastened on to the city, in the belief that the sound of the
firing came from that direction. A large body of the Chinese
however, was observed in full retreat, and a few rockets were
thrown among them to hasten their flight; but, owing to the
many water-courses, and the swampy nature of the rice
grounds, it was impossible to come to close quarters with them.</p>

<p>On reaching the north-gate of the city, there appeared to be
no preparations made for resistance, and the only two guns
which could be seen mounted at the gateway looked harmless
enough. In fact, there was no one at the gate; and two or
three of our men, having contrived to get over the wall, soon
opened the gate, and admitted the rest. It was now discovered
that the place had been abandoned by the authorities the previous
evening. The people generally shewed no ill feeling
towards the foreigners, but rather an inclination to conciliate
their good offices.</p>

<p>The city, which, though wealthy, and of more agreeable
aspect than most other Chinese towns which had been visited,
was not given up to plunder; indeed, Sir Hugh Gough used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
every means in his power to prevent the commission of any
excesses whatever. Very little plunder, or, as it was called,
"loot," was obtained, and was almost entirely limited to
curiosities. There was no wanton aggression. Many of the
houses were found deserted, and these were the only ones
which suffered, except where downright robbery was committed
by the gangs of Chinese plunderers.</p>

<p>Every effort was made to put a stop to these abominable
proceedings, and some of the most respectable inhabitants
were called upon to take charge of a few of the large deserted
establishments, particularly the pawnbrokers' shops, which, in
all Chinese towns, are establishments of enormous extent.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the city was taken possession of, and guards
placed at the gates, the Columbine and Medusa were sent a
little way up the river, to endeavour to check the depopulation
of the city, for the inhabitants at that time were hastening
away in crowds, so that the river was actually covered with
boats of all descriptions, laden with furniture and goods.
The Nemesis was also sent up in search of war-junks, and to
reconnoitre the country. No further hostile preparations,
however, were discovered. Quiet was maintained within the
city, and the vessels of war and steamers were all anchored
directly opposite the town.</p>

<p>The vast number of large trading-junks, which were lying
there, surprised every one. Many of these were laden with
valuable cargoes; both banks of the river were completely
lined with them; and there were also numerous large stone
warehouses, filled with merchandize, some of which contained
large quantities of sugar, salt, and provisions; there were also
extensive timber-yards, and several large junks upon the
stocks.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Shanghai must be a place of immense commercial importance,
not only as regards the internal traffic of the
country, but also in respect to its foreign commerce, or at
least its trade with the remoter parts of China, and even with
Siam and Cochin-China. It is said to rank second only to
Canton in commercial importance, particularly as the junks
belonging to the southern provinces are prohibited from
trading further north than this city, which therefore, in a
certain degree, enjoys a monopoly. During Mr. Medhurst's
visit to it, he reckoned that there were a thousand large junks
in the river; and on visiting it, not long after it was taken,
and when the trade was almost entirely stopped, I was myself
much struck with the large size of the junks, which crowded
both sides of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. Gutzlaff states that the imports of Shanghai already
far exceed the exports; and, therefore, the difficulty again
arises as to the mode of payment for the <i>additional</i> imports,
which will soon find their way to Shanghai since the opening
of the port. The Americans look forward to getting a large
supply of green tea at Shanghai in exchange for their cotton,
green tea being in extensive use among them.</p>

<p>Shanghai has immense internal communication with all the
central parts of China; it is situated in the richest and most
productive part of the country, and the adjacent district has
been called the Chinese Arcadia. The country is one fertile
flat, occasionally subject to ravages by inundations, but generally
drained and cultivated with great care. In some parts,
the land, lying below the level of the rivers, is only maintained
by strong and extensive embankments. The whole country
is covered with hamlets and villages, and cotton is cultivated
in great quantities.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Shanghai have, on all occasions, shewn
a friendly disposition towards foreigners; and where the latter
have been treated with rudeness, it has been solely by the
orders of the mandarins, or at their instigation. Both Mr.
Medhurst and Mr. Gutzlaff bear testimony to this fact, during
their early visits; on which occasions the people eagerly asked
to receive books, of which several thousand copies were distributed.
So important is the trade of this place, that the
appointments in the public service are anxiously sought for,
and the office of superintendent of customs is considered
extremely lucrative.</p>

<p>Mr. Gutzlaff's testimony respecting this place is curious.
Speaking of his visit, in 1832, he says, "the mandarins never
directly interfered with my distributing books or conversing
with the people; and after issuing the severest edicts against
us, they gave us <i>full permission to do what we liked</i>. They
afterwards praised our conduct, but gave the people their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
paternal advice to have nothing to do with us. An imperial
edict arrived, ordering us to be treated with <i>compassion</i>, but
not to be supplied with rice or water. But they sent us quantities
of live stock and flour, upon the sole condition that <i>we
would not pay for them</i>." It is, in fact, a curious thing to observe
how easily the Chinese evade all regulations when their
interest leads them to do so, and how readily they adopt every
subterfuge.</p>

<p>I chanced to pay a visit to Shanghai the very day after the
conclusion of peace was first made known in the town. We
landed from our boat, at a little stone jetty in front of a deserted
temple, before which there was an open paved court, or
square, crowded with people. Nothing could surpass the good
order which prevailed; not a noise or groan was heard, or
inconvenience of any kind experienced. Curiosity seemed to
be the sole absorbing feeling, and one could hardly imagine
that this was only the first week of peace, and that a hostile
force had a short time before occupied the city. A Chinese
crowd is the most orderly in the world; and, if we may judge
of civilization by the quiet, sober, deferential bearing of a
large body of people crowded together in narrow streets, certainly
the Chinese deserve to bear the palm. A few soldiers
were appointed to attend us through the town, who, instead of
arms, carried a fan-case, tied round their waist, and a whip in
their hand, with which they cleared the way with apparent
good will, as we proceeded along the streets of the suburbs.</p>

<p>It was a curious sight to look down the long, narrow, paved
street, on each side of which were crowds of shaved heads,
each trying to raise itself an inch or two higher, to catch a
glimpse of the passing strangers. The steps and doorways
were crowded, and also a few of the windows; but most of the
shops being shut, and the houses having generally only one
story, there were none of those groups of figures, men, women,
and children, rising in stages, one above the other, such as
are seen in Europe from the bottom of the house to the top,
when anything remarkable is to be seen.</p>

<p>The greatest contrast, next to the immense collection of
bald heads, and brown, roundish, ugly-looking features, consisted
in the total absence of women, which, in any part of
Europe, would have formed perhaps the most numerous and
noisy part of the assemblage. There was no appearance whatever
of rudeness or hostility; and when the people were
warned out of the way, or pushed aside, and reminded, by a
gentle touch of the whip, that they must move out of the way,
they did so in apparent good humour.</p>

<p>The inner town appeared to be only separated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
suburb by the actual wall, there being little difference in the
houses on one side or the other. Two or three additional
soldiers turned out of the guard-house as we passed, and joined
our escort, certainly a shabby-looking set.</p>

<p>Much was said of the so-called tea-gardens of Shanghai;
but, on reaching them, great was our astonishment to find
that they ought rather to be called <i>tea-ponds</i>. According to
our notions, land and grass, and plants and flowers, are supposed
to belong to gardens&mdash;even to tea-gardens; but, at
Shanghai, it is quite the reverse, for water predominates.</p>

<p>Ornamental gardening in China, properly so called, is extremely
uncommon. At Canton there is a very good garden
belonging to a Hong merchant; but, generally speaking, the
land is too precious, for the purpose of producing food, to
permit the Chinese to devote much space even to fruits.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the tea-gardens our approach was greeted
by the plaintive voice of an old woman, who professed to sing
songs to the accompaniment of an instrument of a peculiar
kind, covered with snakeskin. It had three strings fastened
to a long handle, with a small drum at the end of it, and was
played with a bow.</p>

<p>The gardens were more remarkable from their novelty than
their beauty. The place consisted in reality of a sheet of
nearly stagnant water, with paths or platforms, or little islands,
intersecting it in various directions, upon which were built
summer-houses, or pavilions of various shapes, in Chinese
style, in which the good citizens of Shanghai assemble to
drink tea (at any hour of the <i>day</i>), and smoke the pipe, which
is a Chinaman's invariable companion, for recreation. There
were also a few walks among heaps of stones, called artificial
rocks, with seats scattered here and there; but in most respects
the whole place greatly disappointed our expectations.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable objects at Shanghai were the
enormous ice-houses, both within and without the city, in
which ice is stored for public use. This was a perfect luxury
to our soldiers and sailors when the place was taken.</p>

<p>We spent the night in a deserted joss-house, close to the
landing-place; and, during the evening and the following day,
crowds of curious visitors came to look at us, and made themselves
agreeable as well as they could. They seemed to be
particularly pleased with the Company's new rupees with the
queen's head upon them, and willingly gave half a dollar each
for them;&mdash;being rather more than their value. Glass bottles
were in great request, and the <i>brandy</i> was pronounced excellent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the principal mandarins came down to pay us a
visit, preceded by criers and runners; then came whippers-in,
and a couple of executioners, with chains in their hands, as a
sign of their calling; then came the great man, seated in a
very gay sedan-chair; next followed a couple of dirty-looking
fellows with gigantic fans; and two or three men mounted on
ponies closed the procession. The people stood on either
side the street, and gazed in silence. They had little curiosity
about the movements of the great man, but a vast deal concerning
every step or look of the strange-looking foreigners.
The mandarin was extremely courteous and well-bred towards
us, and we observed that he was treated with great deference,
and no one except ourselves dared to sit in his presence.</p>

<p>An interesting incident occurred at Shanghai, not long after
the peace. Sir Henry Pottinger, on his return from Nankin,
went up in a steamer to Shanghai, to make arrangements
about the future place of residence for our consul, and also to
settle about the ransom-money of the city. One morning, a
boat came alongside the steamer, having on board a very respectable-looking
man, in Chinese costume, who sent up his
card as "M. l'Evêque de Nankin," at the same time requesting
an interview with the plenipotentiary.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> This was readily acceded
to. It now appeared that this gentleman was the head
of the Roman-catholic missionaries of the province or district
of Nankin; that he had been many years in China, suffering
great tribulation, and in continual danger of his life; that the
missionaries had suffered great hardships, and many of them
had lost their lives. For a great length of time he had not
been able to hold any communication with his fellow-labourers
in any other part of China, and had been deprived of all
tidings from any other country. He had lived in fear and
trembling, but had personally escaped persecution by leading
a very retired and unobtrusive life, and particularly by avoiding
all interference in public matters. He had been afraid to
make himself known, or to have any communication with
Europeans, as long as the war lasted, as it would probably
have caused him trouble. His flock was numerous, but scattered.
He had supported himself entirely by his missionary
labours, and had now joyfully seized the opportunity to request
that letters might be conveyed for him to Macao. He
had removed from Nankin, on the approach of our forces;
and altogether there was much interest attached to his history.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>
<p>There is a great abundance of game to be found in the
neighbourhood of Shanghai, principally pheasants, and various
kinds of wild fowl. But it greatly astonishes the Chinese that
any man should take the trouble to shoot birds, or find any
amusement in the sport, when he could easily get people to
shoot them for him upon very slight payment.</p>

<p>The sum agreed to be paid for the ransom of Shanghai was
said to be three hundred thousand dollars, which was considered
in the light of a contribution, similar to the ransom-money
of Canton. Whatever the amount may have been, it
was reckoned as part of the money stipulated for by the treaty
of Nankin.</p>

<p>A quantity of guns, arms, and military stores, were, as usual,
found in the arsenal within the city, and also large stores of
rice. Sixty-eight guns (exclusive of those in the batteries
below the town) were captured at Shanghai. Seventeen of
these were of copper, newly-cast, and very heavy, and, consequently,
valuable for the prize fund. In a battery facing the
river, fifty-six guns were found, of which seventeen were brass
6-pounders. Altogether at Shanghai one hundred and seventy-one
guns were captured. But, reckoning the whole number
of guns taken in these operations, both at Woosung and
at Shanghai, and in the various batteries on the river's banks,
they will be found to amount to the amazing number of three
hundred and sixty pieces, exclusive of those destroyed in the
junks. Of these seventy-six were of copper, some of them of
great length and weight of metal, but of proportionably small
bore. They looked very well outside, but the casting of many
of them was defective, and not a few were made with a coating,
or rather tube, of iron, about one and a half to two inches thick,
along the bore, over which the copper was cast. At Shanghai
also full nine tons of gunpowder were found, contained in three
hundred and thirty tubs and jars. All the military stores
were destroyed.</p>

<p>It was evident that great preparations had been made for
the hoped-for defence of this important place; but, when the
hour of trial came, and the news of the action at Woosung
reached the city, the principal mandarins quitted it in despair,
and all hope of defence was given up.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th (the day after the city was
taken), Captain Bourchier and Commander Kellett were
ordered to proceed in the Phlegethon, accompanied by the
Medusa, together with the barge of the Cornwallis, carrying a
few marines, and also a boat from the Columbine, to reconnoitre
the river for a distance of thirty miles above the town.
Two small field-works of five guns each were discovered upon
the right bank of the river, and a considerable body of soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
were discovered at some distance in the rear. Lieutenant
Wise was sent, with the boats and marines of the Cornwallis,
for the purpose of destroying the works, which was effected
without any resistance.</p>

<p>The report of what had been seen and done this day was
considered so important and interesting, that Sir William
Parker determined to continue the examination in person next
day, still further up the river. About fifty marines and seamen
were embarked in the Nemesis, and the Admiral hoisted
his flag in her, accompanied by Captain Bourchier, Honourable
Captain Keppel, Captain Lock, and other officers; and
about noon, on the 21st, they proceeded up the river, followed
by the Phlegethon and Medusa.</p>

<p>The river gradually became narrower, but still carried from
four to six fathoms water, and appeared to have an immense
number of canals and water-courses connected with it. Many
of these led directly towards the towns and villages, some of
which could be just seen at a distance, others not far from the
banks. The country looked rich, and was carefully laid out
in rice-grounds, and otherwise well cultivated. It was not so
picturesque as about Ningpo, but there was all the appearance
of a thriving and industrious population. A heavy
storm of thunder and lightning came on in the afternoon, and
the three steamers were brought to anchor for the night a
little above the two forts destroyed the day before.</p>

<p>On the following morning they again pursued their course
up the river, and soon found that it divided itself into two
branches of equal size, one flowing down from the eastward,
and the other coming from the westward. They followed the
latter, which gradually took a more northerly direction, but
the water shoaled as they proceeded, until, at the distance of a
few miles from where they started, there was only one fathom;
and, as the Nemesis and Phlegethon could not safely ascend
higher, the Admiral, with the other officers, removed on board
the Medusa, which being smaller, drew a foot to eighteen
inches less water. But they were not able to go up more than
eight or nine miles further; for they were stopped by the
increasing shallowness of the water at the entrance of a large
lagoon. It was ascertained, however, from some boatmen,
who stated that they had left Soo-chow-foo only the previous
day, that there was a direct communication by water with that
city, which could not be a great many miles distant. It could
not be doubted, therefore, that this important city was easily
accessible to our forces, should it be thought advisable to
advance upon it.</p>

<p>Several large boats were coming down the river, laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
coal, said to be brought from the neighbourhood of Soo-chow-foo,
where iron also is believed to abound. Indeed, coal of
very fair quality is found in many parts of this province, and
the Nemesis was using it for steam purposes at that very
time.</p>

<p>The whole distance ascended above Shanghai was about
forty-five miles, and it was matter of regret that time could
not be spared to explore the other, or eastern branch of the
river. Several large pagodas were seen at a distance, one in
particular to the northward, probably pointing out the neighbourhood
of a large town.</p>

<p>The same evening the three iron steamers returned to
Shanghai, and anchored abreast of the town, where his Excellency,
Sir Henry Pottinger, had just arrived from Hong-Kong,
having touched at Amoy and at Chusan on his way up. It
was also announced that strong reinforcements had arrived at
Chusan, and might be expected to join our forces in the
Yangtze-Kiang in a few days. The names of ships and
regiments will be given together, in the order in which they
moved up the river leading to Nankin. It will be sufficient
here to mention, that no less than seventy-three vessels of
war and transports set sail from Woosung together; besides
which two others were left at that anchorage, in order to
blockade the river leading to Shanghai. Several other vessels
joined the expedition on its way up to Nankin, and afterwards.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>All intention of advancing upon the important cities of
Hang-chow or Soo-chow-foo was now given up; large reinforcements
had already arrived, and more were daily expected
at Woosung; and it was resolved to advance immediately
upon Nankin, the ancient capital of the empire. The navigation
of the Yangtze river was almost entirely unknown,
only a small portion of it having been surveyed by Captain
Bethune in the Conway. To the Chinese themselves the
ascent of large ships or junks, as far as Nankin, appeared
quite impracticable, principally owing to the amazing strength
of the currents, and the numerous sand-banks which render
its channel intricate.</p>

<p>Sir William Parker, however, felt so much confidence in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
own resources, and in the aid of his numerous steam-vessels,
(several more of which had now arrived,) that he did not
hesitate to undertake the bold measure of conducting a fleet
of between seventy and eighty sail, including two <i>line of battle
ships</i>, besides the large troop-ships, into the very heart of the
empire, more than two hundred miles from the sea. The
whole commerce of this vast Yangtze river would thus be cut
off; the Grand Canal itself would be blockaded, and it was
hoped that we should be able to intercept the large fleet of
grain-junks, which, at this time of the year, carry up their
cargoes to the imperial metropolis, and not only furnish its
inhabitants with food, but also the imperial treasury <i>with
tribute</i>. It appeared, however, from official documents afterwards
found at Chin-keang-foo, the Tartar stronghold at the
mouth of the Grand Canal, that the authorities had anticipated
the possibility of their communications being interrupted, and
had, therefore, hastened on this annual supply, and had collected
a body of militia to act as an escort for it. It was
ascertained that these grain-junks had all crossed the Yangtze
river, from the southern to the northern branch of the canal,
on the 26th of June&mdash;viz., a few days before our fleet left
Woosung.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June, our troops returned from Shanghai to
Woosung, principally on board the steamers; but two companies
of the 18th, and the Rifles, together with the horses of
the artillery, marched back by land, the guns being brought
down on board the vessels. The Nemesis, having conveyed
her detachments of troops to their respective transports,
volunteered to go and fetch off the other division, and also
the horses, which had marched overland, and had been waiting
for several hours at Woosung without the means of getting
on board their ships. The men were embarked direct from
the river's bank, and the horses were hoisted in with slings,
and it was late at night before they were put on board their
respective transports; in doing which one boat was unfortunately
capsized.</p>

<p>The Belleisle, with the whole of the 98th on board, had just
arrived from England, together with the Rattlesnake troop-ship,
and the Vixen, heavily-armed steamer, Commander H.
Boyes; and the Proserpine, Captain J. J. Hough, R.N. They
were preceded by the Endymion, 44 guns, Captain Honourable
F. W. Grey; the Dido, 20, Honourable H. Keppel; Calliope,
26, Captain A. S. Kuper, C.B.; Childers, 16, Commander
Halsted; and numerous transports, having on board
the 2nd and 6th regiments Madras Native Infantry; also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
Bengal Volunteers, and reinforcements of artillery, together
with the necessary proportion of camp followers.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards two French ships of war also arrived at
Woosung, for the purpose of watching our movements&mdash;the
Erigone, 44, Captain Cecille, and the Favorite, 18, Captain Le
Page. The latter attempted to follow the fleet up the river,
and the Admiral was politely requested to allow the use of
one of his steamers to assist her in getting up; but this, of
course, could not be complied with, as our steamers were all
indispensable, to enable the numerous fleet of transports to
stem the current, and to tow them off whenever they chanced
to get on shore.</p>

<p>Before our forces left Shanghai, the same mandarin who
had before frequently presented himself at head-quarters<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
again made his appearance as the bearer of a communication
from the high authorities to Sir Henry Pottinger. But, as no
document was shewn by which any individual could prove his
having received full authority from the Emperor to treat for
peace, no attention whatever was paid to these very equivocal
overtures. At the same time, however, Sir Henry Pottinger
published a very important and interesting proclamation,
addressed to the Chinese people, and adopting something of
the tone of Oriental language. It was, of course, published
in Chinese. The opening sentences form a sort of quaint
imitation of the celestial style, with the object, probably, of
fixing the attention of the Chinese at the outset. For instance:
"Under the canopy of heaven, and within the circumference
of the earth, many are the different countries: of the
multitude of these, not one is there that is not ruled by the
Supreme Heavenly Father, nor are there any that are not
brethren of one family. Being then of one family, very plain
is it that they should hold friendly and brotherly intercourse
together, and not boast themselves one above the other."
After this exordium, it proceeds to lay open the grievances of
the English, the extortions and double dealings of the local
authorities at Canton, gradually increasing year after year;
and then recapitulates the proceedings adopted by the English,
their visit to the Peiho, the conferences and stipulations
agreed to by Keshen, and rejected by the Imperial Cabinet,
the treacherous attack of the Chinese, and other matters
already fully explained. It then refers to the cruelties practised
upon our countrymen when taken prisoners, either by
being kidnapped, or in cases where they were shipwrecked.
It further reminds the people that in ancient times foreigners
were permitted to trade at various ports in China, to the
manifest advantage of all parties, and that it was only by
false statements and local intrigue that the Emperor was at
length induced to confine the foreign trade solely to Canton,
and to establish the monopoly of the thirteen Hongs. Finally,
it is declared that hostilities will continue to be carried on,
until some high officer shall be appointed by the Emperor,
with full powers to negotiate and conclude arrangements, of
which the three following points were to be the basis:&mdash;Compensation
for losses and expenses; a friendly and becoming
intercourse, on terms of <i>equality</i>, between officers of the two
countries; and the cession of <i>insular territory</i> for commerce,
and for the residence of merchants, and as a security and
<i>guarantee</i> against future renewal of offensive acts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>
<p>This proclamation was issued the day before the fleet set
sail from Woosung for Nankin. It is a curious coincidence
that, a few days before this, an edict, or proclamation, was
issued by the Emperor, in which <i>he also</i> recapitulated the
leading events of the war, and tried to make it appear that the
whole difficulties had arisen solely from the crusade which his
Majesty had directed to be carried on against the "Opium
poison." He blames Commissioner Lin for his bad management;
and with regard to the six million dollars ransom for
Canton, his celestial Majesty declares that it was a very small
matter, and that he did not grudge it at all. But when the
rebellious foreigners left Canton, and then advanced to recapture
Chusan, and to take Ningpo and other cities, then says
his Majesty, with unaffected bitterness of spirit, "I severely
blame <i>myself</i>, and hate <i>myself</i> for being unequal to my duties;
I cannot rescue my subjects; and repose by day or night is
difficult for me." At the same time, he is slow to believe that
the strength of the barbarian ships is really so great as represented,
and strongly hints that his people are cowards; and
while, on the one hand, he promises rewards to the valiant, he
orders that those who run away shall be instantly executed
without mercy. Carefully losing sight of every other grievance
or source of difficulties, his Majesty reiterates his prohibition
against opium, and urges the most strenuous exertions to
sweep the worthless barbarians clean away into the depths of
the wide ocean.</p>

<p>In fact, it now became very manifest that the Emperor was
seriously alarmed; and, although his spirit breathed a bitter
hostility, it could not be doubted that his Majesty ardently
longed for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Henry's proclamation soon afterwards called forth a
reply from Niew-kien, the Viceroy of the two Kiang provinces,
to which the seat of war was now removed. It was one of those
curious little essays in which the Chinese delight, made up of a
few common-place truisms dressed in the peculiar phraseology
of the East. He cunningly recommends the plenipotentiary
to draw up a full statement of all <i>grievances</i>, to be transmitted
through him (the Viceroy) to the Emperor, which would of
course bear upon its very face the appearance of <i>asking for
favours</i>, instead of dictating <i>terms</i>. He farther reminds his
Excellency, that although the Chinese have suffered much,
still the English must have lost many brave men also, and by
coming from so great a distance must have likewise incurred
great expense; that it would be much better for <i>both parties</i>
to put an end to the war at once, and vows the most perfect
sincerity before all the gods. At the same time, he confesses
his great alarm at seeing all the people fly from their habitations,
and the country given up to the plundering of the
<i>native</i> robbers. Indeed, Miew-Kien, in another report addressed
to the Emperor, expressed the greatest possible apprehension
lest the people should be frightened away, either
by severe measures on his own part, or by the approach of the
enemy, and thus the whole country be given up to the excesses
of the lawless native plunderers, who would take the
opportunity to rob, and commit all kinds of mischief.</p>

<p>The Chinese appear to have rested all their hopes for the
defence of the Yangtze river, and the approach to Nankin,
entirely upon the strength of their works at Woosung, and had
consequently made little or no preparations for resistance
higher up. It had, indeed, been recommended by one of the
Tartar generals that a portion of the river below Nankin should
be staked across, and junks laden with stones sunk to impede
the navigation, and likewise that fire-vessels should be prepared.
But this advice was overruled by Niew-Kien, the
Viceroy, upon the ground of its inutility; and it was urged
that the extreme rapidity of the current, and the sunken rocks
and sands in parts most difficult of navigation, would be the
best defences, and that any attempts to stake the river would
not only be expensive and useless, but would greatly alarm the
people. Fire-rafts were only ordered to be got ready, when
there was no time whatever even to commence them, the enemy
being already close to the city of Chin-keang-foo.</p>

<p>From documents which subsequently fell into our possessions
it was also ascertained that the apprehension of our advance
upon Pekin by way of the river Peiho was so great, that a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
of troops, already ordered to march to Soo-chow-foo, were recalled,
and directed to proceed immediately to Tientsin, in
order to defend the approaches to the metropolis.</p>

<p>During the latter part of June, the weather was very squally
and unsettled, and therefore not very well adapted for the
advance of a fleet of more than seventy sail, up a river, the
navigation of which was almost entirely unknown. The
channels were now buoyed off, and beacon-vessels were also
placed at one or two of the most important parts; and Commanders
Kellett and Collinson, accompanied by the masters of
the ships of war were sent in advance on the 29th, to sound
and to make preparations for the passage of the fleet, and
particularly for the purpose of surveying the river above the
point where Captain Bethune's researches terminated.</p>

<p>The distance of Nankin from Woosung is about one hundred
and seventy miles, and a very accurate survey was ultimately
completed of this beautiful river, as far as that ancient capital.
Even there the river is very broad and the channel deep, so
that the Cornwallis was able to lie within one thousand yards
of the walls of the city. It is, perhaps, to be regretted that
the river was not examined for some distance above the city,
for it could not be doubted that, with the assistance of steamers,
even large ships would be able to ascend several hundred
miles further. But the conclusion of the peace followed so
soon after the arrival of our forces before the ancient capital,
that there was no opportunity of continuing our discoveries
further into the interior, without compromising our character
for sincerity, while the negotiations were in progress. It
could not have failed, however, had circumstances permitted,
of furnishing much interesting information respecting the
interior of this extraordinary country.</p>

<p>There are few rivers in the world to be compared with the
Yangtze, in point of extent, and the richness of the provinces
through which it flows. Supposed to take its rise at a distance
of more than three thousand miles from the sea, among
the furthest mountains of Thibet, it traverses the whole empire
of China from west to east, turning a little to the northward,
and is believed to be navigable through the whole of
these valuable provinces.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>
<p>The navigation of this river was found less difficult than
might have been expected. There are, indeed, numerous
sand-banks, some of which change their places, owing to the
rapidity of the current; and at the upper part of the river,
towards Chin-keang-foo, there is some danger from rocks;
but the greatest obstacle to the navigation is the rapidity of
the current, which, even when beyond the influence of the
tide, runs down at the rate of three and a half to four miles
an hour. It is not surprising that almost every ship of the
squadron should have touched the ground; but, as the bottom
was generally soft mud, no serious damage was sustained.
The steamers were of course indispensable, and the assistance
of two or three of them together was, in some instances,
requisite to haul the ships off.</p>

<p>One of the largest transports, the Marion, having the head-quarters
and staff on board, was thrown upon the rocks by
the force of the current, on the way <i>down</i> from Nankin, and
would certainly have been lost, but for the aid rendered by
two steamers, the Nemesis and the Memnon, and the valuable
experience already gained by the former in the Chinese
rivers.</p>

<p>Sir William Parker's arrangements for the merchant transports
were perfect; their orders were definite, and were generally
obeyed with alacrity; boats were always in readiness, and
signals carefully watched. Probably, if it were required to
point out any one circumstance which redounded more than
another to the honour of the British service, it would be that
of having carried a fleet of nearly eighty sail up to the walls
of the city of Nankin and brought it safely back again.</p>

<p>At the beginning of July, the weather became very favourable
for the ascent of the river, and the Phlegethon, having
returned with the intelligence that a clear and deep channel
had been found as far as Golden Island, close to the entrance
of the Grand Canal, and that buoys had been laid down to
facilitate the navigation, orders were given that the fleet should
be in readiness to get under weigh on the morning of the 6th.
It was formed into five divisions, each consisting of from
eight to twelve transports, conducted by a ship-of-war, and
under the orders of her captain; and to each division also a
steamer was attached, to render assistance when required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the steamers so employed, the Phlegethon,
Medusa, and Pluto were in attendance, principally upon the
advanced squadron, and in readiness to assist any other ship
which stood in need of it. The Nemesis and Proserpine also
accompanied the fleet. Thus there were not less than ten
steamers attached to the squadron when it set sail from Woosung,
and they were afterwards joined up the river (but not
until hostilities had ceased) by two other powerful steamers,
the Driver and the Memnon.</p>

<p>A list of all her majesty's ships of war and steam vessels,
together with those belonging to the East India Company,
which were present in the Chinese waters at the conclusion of
the peace, will be given in its proper place. The following
was the order of sailing of the squadron on leaving Woosung,
each division being about two or three miles in advance of the
next one. The North Star, Captain Sir E. Home, Bart., was
left at Woosung to blockade that river, with orders to detain
all merchant junks which might attempt to pass up the
Yangtze, or into the Woosung, laden with provisions.</p>

<p>It was a curious sight afterwards to look at the numerous
fleet of junks, some of them of large size, which were collected
at that anchorage, and for some time it was no easy matter for
the North Star to prevent them from attempting to make their
escape; but when a round shot or two had been sent through
some of the most refractory, and a few of the captains had
been brought on board the North Star and strictly warned,
they all became "very submissively obedient," and patiently
awaited the permission to depart, which was not accorded to
them until the peace had been proclaimed.</p>

<p>The advanced squadron consisted of the&mdash;</p>

<p>The Chinese had prepared no means of resisting the advance
of our squadron up the river; and even the few guns which
had previously been mounted on two small forts on the
right bank of the river, adjoining the towns of Foushan and
Keang-yin, were withdrawn on the approach of our forces, in
order to avert the injury which might have been done to those
towns had any show of resistance been offered.</p>

<p>The country along the lower part of the Yangtze is altogether
alluvial, and intersected by innumerable canals and
water-courses. In most parts it is highly cultivated, but in
others less so than we were led to expect. On one occasion,
I walked for the distance of five or six miles into the interior,
attended by crowds of the peasantry, who appeared to be a
strong, hardy, well-disposed race, and offered no kind of
violence or insult. They appeared to be solely influenced by
curiosity, and a few of them brought us poultry for sale, but
the greater part seemed afraid to have any dealings with us.
The small cotton plant was cultivated very extensively, and
at nearly every cottage-door an old woman was seated, either
picking the cotton or spinning it into yarn. The hop plant
was growing abundantly in a <i>wild state</i>, and was apparently
not turned to any use.</p>

<p>The small town of Foushan, at the base of a partially fortified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
hill, and a conical mountain with a pagoda upon its
summit, situated upon the opposite side of the river, form the
first striking objects which meet the eye, and relieve the
general monotony of the lower part of the river. Above this
point, the scenery becomes more interesting, and gradually
assumes rather a mountainous character.</p>

<p>Compared with the neighbourhood of Ningpo, or Chapoo,
you are inclined to be disappointed in the aspect of the
country generally; you find it less carefully and economically
cultivated, and perhaps one of your first hasty impressions
would be to doubt whether the population of China can be so
dense as the best-received accounts lead us to suppose. When
you consider the immense extent of country through which
this magnificent river flows, and the alluvial nature of the
great belt of land which runs along the sea-coast, you are
prepared to expect that here, if anywhere, a great mass of
people would be congregated, and that town would succeed
town, and village follow village, along the whole course of this
great artery.</p>

<p>About twenty-five miles above Foushan, stands the rather
considerable town of Keang-yin, situated in a very picturesque
valley, about a mile distant from the river side; but there is
a small village close to the landing-place. The river suddenly
becomes narrow at this spot, but soon again spreads out to
nearly its former breadth. The town of Keang-yin is distinguished
by a remarkable pagoda, to which, with great difficulty,
we persuaded a venerable-looking priest to conduct us.
He hesitated a long time before he could be induced to lead
us into the town, which was surrounded by a very high, thick,
parapeted wall, banked up with earth on the inside. No
soldiers were to be seen, and many of the inhabitants began
very hastily to shut up their shops the moment they saw us
enter the streets.</p>

<p>The pagoda appeared to be the only striking object in the
place, and from the peculiarity of its construction was well
worth seeing. It was built of red brick, in the usual octagonal
form, gradually inclining upwards, but was so constructed
<i>in the inside</i>, that each story slightly overhung the
one below it, although the outside appeared quite regular.
The building was partly in ruins, but looked as if it had never
been perfectly finished. Not far from it was a well of clear,
delicious water, some of which was brought to us in basins,
with marks of good-nature, as if the people intended to surprise
us with a treat. We afterwards learned that good water
is rarely found in the neighbourhood of the river, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the inhabitants are in the habit of purifying it by dissolving
in it a small portion of alum. It was also stated that fish
caught in the river are considered unwholesome.</p>

<p>The distance from Keang-yin to Chin-keang-foo is about
sixty-six miles by the river, but not much more than half
that distance by land, the course of the former being very
tortuous. The country gradually increases in interest, becoming
more hilly and picturesque the higher you ascend.</p>

<p>At Seshan, which is about fifteen miles below Chin-keang-foo,
some show of opposition was offered by two or three
small batteries, mounting twenty guns, situated at the foot of
a remarkable conical hill. They opened fire at first upon the
Pluto and Nemesis steamers, which were at that time employed
on the surveying service. The day afterwards they
opened fire also upon the Phlegethon and Modeste, which
were sent forward to attack them. The garrison were, however,
soon driven out, and could be seen throwing off their
outer wadded jackets, to enable them to escape with greater
nimbleness. The guns, magazines, and barracks, were destroyed.</p>

<p>A little way below Chin-keang-foo, the channel is much
narrowed by the island of Seung-shan, and the current is consequently
extremely rapid, so that the utmost skill and care,
aided by a strong breeze, are necessary to enable a vessel to
stem the stream and overcome the strength of the eddies and
whirlpools. Seung-shan, or Silver Island, is all rocky, but
rendered picturesque by the trees which are planted in the
hollows. It is devoted to religious purposes, being ornamented
with temples, and it was formerly honoured by the
visits of the Emperors, to whom it is said still to belong.</p>

<p>Nearly the same description will also apply to Kinshan, or
Golden Island, situated higher up the river, nearly opposite
the mouth of the Grand Canal. It is distinguished by a
pagoda which crowns its summit, and by its numerous yellow
tiled temples. The decayed condition of some of the pavilions,
and the remnants of former splendour which once decorated
their walls, together with the imperial chair itself, ornamented
with well-carved dragons all over its back and sides, attest the
importance which this island and the environs of the great
southern capital possessed in times long past, and the low
estate into which this interesting part of the country has fallen
since Pekin became the metropolis of China, and the Imperial
residence of its Conquerors.</p>

<p>On the 16th, Sir William Parker and Sir Hugh Gough
proceeded up the river in H.M. steamer Vixen, followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the little Medusa, to reconnoitre the approaches to Chin-keang-foo.
They passed up above the city without any opposition,
approaching very near the entrance of the Imperial
Canal, which takes its course close under the city walls. No
preparations for resistance were apparent&mdash;at least, there were
no soldiers visible upon the city walls, and the inhabitants,
who came out in great numbers, were evidently attracted only
by curiosity. Hence the first impression was, that no resistance
would be offered, and the information obtained
through the interpreters tended to encourage the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The walls of the city, which is situated on the right bank
of the river, were, however, in good repair, and the distance
from the river was not too great to enable the ships to bombard
it if requisite. But the general feeling was, that the
attack (if indeed any resistance at all were offered) was to be
left entirely to the military arm of the expedition, the more
particularly as the engagement at Woosung had been entirely
monopolized by the navy, and an opportunity was desired by
the army to achieve for itself similar honours. A second reconnoissance,
made from the top of the pagoda on Golden
Island, brought to view three encampments on the slope of
the hills, a little to the south-west of the city, which rather
tended to confirm the impression that the troops had moved
out of the town.</p>

<p>The advanced squadron, under Captain Bourchier, had been
sent a little higher up, to blockade the entrances of the Grand
Canal, and the other water-communications by which the
commerce of the interior is maintained. On the 19th, the
Cornwallis was enabled to take up a position close off the city,
near the southern entrance of the Grand Canal; and on the
20th, the whole of the fleet had assembled in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that little or no resistance was
expected in the town itself; but the ships might have easily
thrown a few shells into it, to make the enemy shew themselves,
or have regularly bombarded the place if necessary.
It seems, however, to have been settled that it should be altogether
a military affair; and with the exception of some boats,
which were sent up the canal, and a body of seamen who were
landed, and did gallant service under Captain Peter Richards
and Captain Watson, the naval branch of the expedition had
little to do. From documents subsequently found within the
city, it was ascertained that there were actually about two
thousand four hundred fighting men within the walls, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
one thousand two hundred were resident Tartar soldiers, and
four hundred Tartars sent from a distant province. Very few
guns were mounted, as the greater part of them had been
carried down for the defence of Woosung.</p>

<p>Outside the walls there were three encampments, at some
distance from the town, in which there was a force altogether
of something less than three thousand men, with several guns,
and a quantity of ginjals. As the adult Tartar population of
every city are, in fact, soldiers by birth, it may be supposed
that even those who do not belong to the regular service are
always ready to take up arms in defence of their hearths; and
in this way some of our men suffered, because they did not
know, from their external appearance, which were the ordinary
inhabitants, and which were the Tartars.</p>

<p>On our side, the whole force engaged at Chin-keang-foo,
though very much larger than any hitherto brought into the
field in China, did not amount to seven thousand men, including
officers, non-commissioned officers, and rank and file.
The exact numbers, according to the field list, amounted to
six thousand six hundred and sixty-four men, besides officers.
They were divided into four brigades.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 20th, all the arrangements were
completed for the attack upon the city and upon the encampments
beyond it, to take place on the following morning at
daylight. It has been already stated, that it was not proposed
that the ships should bombard the town; and the only vessel
which fired into it was the Auckland steamer, which covered
the landing, and threw a few shot and shells into the city. But
a body of seamen and marines of the squadron (as will presently
be described) took an active share in the work of the
day, under Captain Peter Richards and other officers; and
Sir William Parker himself accompanied the general, and
forced his way with him through the city gate.</p>

<p>The plan adopted by Sir Hugh Gough was to endeavour to
cut off the large body of Chinese troops encamped upon the
slope of the hills; for which purpose the first and third brigades,
together with part of the artillery, were to be landed
in the western suburbs of the city, opposite Golden Island,
near where a branch of the Grand Canal runs close under the
city walls; Lord Saltoun, with the first brigade, was to attack
the encampments; while Sir Hugh Gough, in person, with the
third brigade and the rest of the artillery, proposed to operate
against the west gate, and the western face of the walls.</p>

<p>The second brigade, under Major-General Schoedde, was to
land under a bluff point somewhat to the northward of the
city, where there were two small hills which commanded the
walls on that side. The object was to create a diversion, and
draw the attention of the enemy towards that side, while the
real attack was to be made upon the western gate, which was
to be blown in by powder-bags. General Schoedde was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
directed to use his own discretion, as to turning his diversion
into a real attack, should he think proper to do so.</p>

<p>There was found to be more difficulty in landing the troops
than had been expected, many of the transports lying at a considerable
distance, and the great strength of the current rendering
the operation troublesome and protracted. The first
brigade, under Lord Saltoun, succeeded in driving the enemy
completely over the hills, after receiving a distant and ineffectual
fire as they advanced; but they met with a more determined
resistance from a column of the enemy, who were in
great danger of being cut off. Several casualties occurred on
our side, in this encounter. Upon the walls of the town itself,
few soldiers shewed themselves, and the resistance which was
soon experienced was not at all expected.</p>

<p>General Schoedde, with a portion of the second brigade,
took possession of a joss-house, or temple, upon the hill overlooking
the northern and eastern face of the walls, near the
river, and there awaited the landing of the rest of his brigade,
being received by a spirited fire of guns, ginjals, and matchlocks,
which was opened from the city walls; this was returned
by a fire of rockets.</p>

<p>As soon as a sufficient force had been collected, the rifles,
under Captain Simpson, descended from a small wooded hill
which they occupied, and crept up close under the walls, keeping
up a well sustained fire upon the Tartars. Major-General
Schoedde now gave orders for escalading the wall, although,
from its not having been part of the regular plan of attack,
only three scaling ladders were provided. The grenadier company
of the 55th, with two companies of the 6th Madras
Native Infantry, advanced to the escalade, under the command
of Brevet-Major Maclean, of the 55th. The first man who
mounted the walls was Lieutenant Cuddy, of the 55th, who
remained sitting upon the wall, assisting the others to get up,
with astonishing coolness. He was shortly afterwards wounded
in the foot by a matchlock ball.</p>

<p>The 55th and the 6th Madras Native Infantry vied with
each other in gallantly mounting the ladders, together with
the rifles; but the Tartars fought desperately. As they retreated
along the wall, they made a stand at every defensible
point, sheltering themselves behind the large guard stations
and watch-boxes, which are found at intervals upon most of
the Chinese walls.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes are told by those who were present, of the
desperate determination with which the Tartars fought. Many
of them rushed upon the bayonets. In some instances, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
got within the soldiers' guard, and seizing them by the body,
dragged their enemies with themselves over the walls; and in
one or two instances succeeded in throwing them over, before
they were themselves bayoneted. The Tartars were fine muscular
men, and looked the more so from the loose dresses
which they wore. They did not shrink from sword combats,
or personal encounters of any kind; and had they been armed
with weapons similar to those of our own troops, even without
much discipline, upon the top of walls where the front is
narrow, and the flanks cannot be turned, they would have probably
maintained their ground for a much longer time, and
perhaps even, until they were attacked by another body in the
rear. Major Warren and Captain Simpson were wounded, as
well as Lieutenant Cuddy.</p>

<p>As soon as the wall was scaled, one body of our troops proceeded
to clear the walls to the right, and the other to the
left; and the latter, as they scoured the walls, afterwards fell
in with the third brigade, with the General and the Admiral at
their head, who had just forced their way in at the gateway.
While these important successes had been gained by General
Schoedde with the second brigade, two other operations had
been conducted at the western gate, one by the third brigade,
and the other by a small body of marines and seamen, under
Captain Peter Richards. These are now to be detailed.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Gough, as soon as he had been joined by the
18th and the greater part of the 49th, with the 26th, which
had not accompanied Lord Saltoun's brigade, gave orders to
blow in the west gate with powder-bags. The canal which
runs along the walls on that side was found not to be fordable;
and this was ascertained by four officers who volunteered
to swim across it to ascertain the fact. Sir Hugh Gough was
at this time with the third brigade, under Major-General
Bartley, at about midway between the south and west gates,
but determined to storm the latter, because the suburbs afforded
shelter for the men to approach it, with little exposure. A
few Tartar soldiers only appeared upon the walls at this point,
as the main body had probably been marched off to reinforce
those who were opposed to our troops, after the escalade of
the walls on the northern side.</p>

<p>Two guns, under Lieutenant Molesworth, were placed so as
to command the approach to the gate, and to cover the advance
of a party of sappers and miners, under Captain Pears,
who were to fix the powder-bags against the gate. This operation
was perfectly successful; and the General, putting
himself at the head of the 18th, who had just come up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
rushed in over the rubbish, the grenadiers forming the advance,
and entered a long archway, which led into what might
be called an outwork, from which there was a second gate,
conducting into the town itself.</p>

<p>It appears that in Chinese fortifications, as before described,
there are always two gateways; the outer one placed at right
angles to the main wall of the town, so as to be flanked by it,
and leading into a large court, surrounded by walls similar to
the walls of the town, and in which there are commonly cells
for prisoners, &amp;c. The second gate and archway leads from
it directly into the body of the place, and is surmounted by a
guard-house upon the top of the gateway, to which you ascend
by a flight of stone steps on either side.</p>

<p>All resistance at the gateways had been already overcome,
the Chinese guard at the inner gate having given way before
the advanced party of the 55th regiment; and the open
court, or space between the two gateways, having been just
occupied by a party of marines and seamen, under Captain
Peter Richards and Captain Watson, who had escaladed the
outer wall very near the gateway.</p>

<p>As no detailed account of this interesting part of the day's
work has yet appeared, and as some misapprehension has
prevailed with regard to the affair of the boats of the Blonde
in the canal, I have taken pains to ascertain the particulars
from two officers who were present, and who were both
wounded on the occasion. The following condensed statement
of what took place may therefore be relied on for its
accuracy.</p>

<p>The boats of the Blonde, which vessel was at anchor off
one of the principal southern branches of the Grand Canal
running under the city walls, having been employed in landing
the Artillery Brigade during the early part of the morning,
were ordered, about ten o'clock, to re-embark part of the
Artillery and Gun-Lascars, with two howitzers, for the purpose
of assisting in the attack of the west gate, and to create a
diversion in favour of the troops. At all events, whatever
the object of the movement might have been, it is certain that
the guns were put on board the boats of the Blonde, and that
there were altogether about one hundred men embarked.
The boats consisted of the launch, barge, pinnace, cutter, and
flat of that ship, together with two boats belonging to transports.
They proceeded up the canal, which took a winding
direction through the suburbs, for some distance, until they
came suddenly in sight of the west gate of the city, which
until then had been obscured by the houses. The whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
these boats were under the command of Lieutenant Crouch,
of the Blonde, having Messrs. Lambert, Jenkins, and Lyons,
midshipmen, under his orders.</p>

<p>On coming in sight of the gate, the barge, cutter, and flat
were a little in advance of the other boats, and proceeding in
single line towards a spot pointed out by Major Blundell, of
the Madras Artillery, as well adapted for the landing of the
guns. Suddenly a heavy fire of ginjals and matchlocks was
opened on them from the whole line of the city wall, running
parallel with the canal; and, as the height of it was little less
than forty feet, the small gun of the barge could not be elevated
sufficiently to do any service, and the fire of musketry
which was returned was inefficient.</p>

<p>The Chinese opened their fire with deadly effect upon the
advancing boats, and, in the course of about ten minutes,
sixteen seamen and eight artillerymen were wounded; Lieutenant
Crouch himself was hit in three places, and one midshipman
(Mr. Lyons) and two officers of the Artillery were also
wounded. Under these circumstances, the men were got out
of the boats as quickly as possible, and placed under cover of
the houses in the suburbs, on the opposite side of the canal.
At this time these three boats were considerably in advance of
the rest, and, as soon as the men were all landed, the boats
were abandoned and the guns left behind. The launch and
pinnace, who were behind them, as soon as they saw the disaster,
and that to advance further would only expose themselves
to a destructive fire, without the possibility of returning
it with effect, stopped under cover of some buildings, which
sheltered them from the city walls.</p>

<p>The officers and men who belonged to the advanced boats,
having many of their comrades wounded, were now in a trying
predicament. The only alternative left was to endeavour to
join the other boats which had remained under cover; to do
which they had to pass across an open space by the side of the
canal, exposed to the whole fire of the enemy from the walls
on the opposite side. This was, however, effected without
farther loss, although a heavy fire was opened on them, (but
of course at a greater distance than when in the boats.) Some
of the wounded were necessarily left behind, and were kindly
treated by the Chinese people in the suburbs, who shewed no
hostility.</p>

<p>As it was evident that nothing further could be attempted at
present, they all returned down the canal in the launch and
pinnace, and reported the circumstances to Captain Richards,
of the Cornwallis, to which ship the rest of the wounded were
immediately removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>On receiving the information of what had happened, Captain
Peter Richards lost not a moment in landing with two
hundred marines, at the entrance of the canal, where he was
joined by about three hundred men of the 6th M.N.I., under
Captain Maclean, of that corps, and then pushed through the
suburbs towards the city walls; at the same time the whole of
the boats of the Cornwallis, under the command of Lieutenant
Stoddart, advanced by the canal, in company with the remaining
boats of the Blonde, to bring off the boats and guns
which had been left behind. They were also to endeavour to
check the fire of the Chinese at the west gate, when Captain
Richards advanced through the suburbs to escalade the wall.</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Richards had landed, he was joined by
Captain Watson and Mr. Forster, (master,) of the Modeste,
with a boat's crew and a small body of marines belonging to
that vessel. On reaching the foot of the walls, a heap of
rubbish was luckily found to have been left by accident not
far from the gate. Upon this the ladders were planted by
Captain Peter Richards and Captain Watson, under cover of
the fire of the Marines, in face of a large body of Tartars, who
lined the walls, and appeared determined to defend their post
to the last. These two officers, together with Lieutenant
Baker, of the Madras Artillery, and a private marine of the
Modeste, were the first to ascend the ladders. As they got
upon the wall (with much difficulty) they were directly exposed
to the cross fire from the guard-houses over the outer
and inner gateway, by which the marine was killed, and Captain
Watson and Lieutenant Baker were wounded; the former
having one of the buttons of his jacket driven into his side,
and three balls passing through his jacket. The marine was
killed by several shots passing through his body, and another
marine, (also belonging to the Modeste,) who followed afterwards,
was severely wounded.</p>

<p>With great difficulty and exertion about a dozen men got
upon the wall; and Lieutenant Fitzjames, having succeeded
in bringing up some rockets, lodged one of them in a guard-house
over the gateway, which immediately caught fire, and
threw the enemy into such consternation that they then gave
way. Captain Richards, (who had, as if by a miracle, escaped
being wounded,) was now able to dash down, at the head of his
men, into the open space between the two gateways; and, just
afterwards, the outer gate was blown in, as before described,
by powder-bags. The advanced guard of the 55th had in the
meanwhile come round along the walls from their north-eastern
angle, where General Schoedde's brigade had escaladed
it, and had now reached the inner gateway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>The third brigade, under Major-General Bartley, accompanied
by Sir Hugh Gough, and also by Sir William Parker,
dashed in over the ruins of the gate, and, to their great disappointment,
found that the walls had been already carried;
but, within the city itself, the resistance of the Tartars was by
no means overcome. Part of the 18th and 49th regiments,
under Major-General Bartley, were now ordered to march
along the western face of the walls, and they threw out a line
of skirmishers as they advanced along some ditches and old
houses below the wall. As the brigade filed along the walls
left in front, they suddenly received a heavy fire from a body
of Tartars, by which two officers were killed and two wounded,
and several men struck down. The leading division of the
49th immediately dashed down the ramparts upon the enemy's
left, while the 18th pushed forward to turn their right. They
were soon dispersed, although many of them fought with great
determination. One company of the 18th pursued them into
the Tartar city. In this spirited affair the 18th had one
officer killed and one wounded, with about twenty men killed
and wounded. The loss of the 49th was one officer killed,
one wounded, and about twenty-four rank and file killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Admiral, having put himself at the
head of the seamen and marines, marched some way along the
walls, where they had been already cleared by the 55th, and,
as the heat of the sun at this time (past noon) was almost
insupportable, he had directed the men to take shelter for a
little while, in one of the watch-houses upon the ramparts.
The heat was quite overpowering, and the men being already
much fatigued, several of them died from sun-stroke. Here
it was that the gallant Major Uniacke, R.M., fell, from the
effects of the sun, and in the list of casualties of the day no less
than sixteen men are included, who died from the same cause.</p>

<p>Having rested something less than an hour in the guard-house,
a heavy firing was heard within the Tartar city, and
the men were instantly formed, and advanced in the direction
of the firing, under Captain Richards and Captain Watson.
On passing through a narrow street in the Tartar part of the
city, a sudden fire was poured upon them by a body of Tartars
drawn up across the street, behind a small gateway, where
they seemed prepared to make a most determined stand.
Several men were wounded, and it was necessary to advance
with caution, taking advantage of shelter when it could be
found. Here Lieutenant Fitzjames was wounded while endeavouring
to get a rocket off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Watson was now sent round by a side-lane, to
endeavour to turn the flank of the Tartars, but there also the
latter were prepared for them, behind a temporary barricade.
However, a cheer, and a sudden rush from both divisions at
once, upon the front and flank of the Tartars, carried the
point, and the enemy were driven back with heavy loss, after
shewing individual instances of the most desperate valour, in
several hand-to-hand encounters. When the brave Tartars at
length saw that their utmost efforts were of no avail, then
began the scenes of horror, and the tragedy of self-immolation,
which makes one's very blood run cold to hear of. The Admiral
himself was a witness of what took place. Some of the
Tartars kept the doors of their houses with their very lives,
while others could be seen within, deliberately cutting the
throats of their women, and destroying their children, some
by strangulation, and others by throwing them into the wells.
In one house in particular, a Tartar was found in the act of
sawing his wife's throat with a rusty sword, as he held her over
the mouth of the well into which his children had been already
thrown. He was shot before the deed was completed, in
order to save the woman, who was immediately taken care of,
and had the wound, which was not severe, tied up. Yet the
first use she made of her tongue, as soon as she could speak,
was to utter the most violent imprecations upon the heads of
the victors. The children who were in the well (in which
there was little water) were all got up, and recovered.</p>

<p>In other houses, numbers of poor creatures were found
dead, some by their own hands or the hands of each other,
and the rest by the hands of their husbands. In one house
no less than fourteen dead bodies were discovered, principally
women; in others the men began to cut their own throats the
moment they saw any of our soldiers approaching; while in
other instances they rushed out furiously from some hiding-place,
and attacked with the sword any one who came in their
way.</p>

<p>Several of our officers had to defend their own lives with
the sword, long after all systematic opposition had ceased.
An officer of the 14th M.N.I. had a sword combat with three
Tartars who rushed out upon him sword in hand, and by retreating
so as to endeavour to take them singly, he was able
to cut down two of them just at the moment when a fatal blow
was about to be aimed at him by the third, who was fortunately
shot at the very critical moment, by a soldier who was
coming up to his officer's assistance.</p>

<p>It is impossible to calculate the number of victims to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
barbarous practice of self-immolation and wholesale murder.
Chin-keang-foo was a Tartar stronghold considered by them
as impregnable; they could not brook defeat, or the desecration
of their hearths, by the tread of the unknown but
thoroughly-hated barbarian; every house had its victims; and
to add to the horrors of the day, and the desolation of the
city, the Chinese plunderers flocked in from the country in
multitudes, pillaging in all directions. They even set fire to
the streets in some parts, to enable them to carry on their
work with less interruption in others.</p>

<p>On our side, although the place had been taken by storm,
and not without heavy loss, the strictest orders were given to
prevent the pillage of the town as much as possible. Measures
were taken, not only to control our own men, (who, according
to European custom, might have expected to be allowed to
pillage a town taken by assault,) but also to arrest the violent
proceedings of the Chinese rabble, who, in this as in other
instances, were the worst enemies of their own countrymen.</p>

<p>The authorities and nearly all the respectable inhabitants
had fled; and the Tartar general (who had complained bitterly
to the Emperor of insufficient means for defence) had
set fire to his own house, and buried himself and part of his
family in its ashes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the attempts to prevent the destruction
of property, it was impossible altogether to arrest it in so
large a city. Plunder was sometimes taken from the <i>Chinese
thieves outside</i> the town, and occasionally articles of value
were thrown over the walls, because they were not allowed to
be carried through the gates. In this way, plunder was
sometimes obtained, and many ingenious devices were adopted
to endeavour to secure a few valuables; but nearly all the
mischief was done by the Chinese themselves.</p>

<p>The public offices were taken possession of by our troops,
and all the arms and warlike stores which were found were
destroyed. Only sixty thousand dollars, worth of Sycee silver
was found in the public coffers; but a little addition was
made to the prize fund by the sale of articles which were taken
from plunderers, when they were discovered trying to carry
property out of the gates. The waste and destruction of property
was, however, enormous. When more valuable objects
were discovered, those of smaller value were left in the streets;
costly furs lay strewed in all directions; silks and satins lay
about in such profusion that the only difficulty was to choose
among them. So little had the inhabitants expected that
their stronghold would fall, that valuables of all kinds, gems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
and gold ornaments, and curiosities of every description, and
in some instances even money, were left in the wardrobes of
the best houses, at the mercy of the first comers. Under these
circumstances, it is surprising that so little plunder was carried
away from a city taken by assault.</p>

<p>Terrible as was the downfall of Chin-keang-foo in the eyes
of the Chinese, and great as was the desolation throughout
the city in every direction, it cannot be doubted that the loss
of this important Tartar stronghold, and the panic created by
it, (the whole trade of the country being at the same time
suspended,) tended very materially to produce in the mind of
the Emperor and of his ministers the conviction that a speedy
peace, on any terms, was preferable to a continuance of the
war.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

empire cannot but strike every one with astonishment. Most of them naturally
take their course from west to east, from the mountains towards the sea; but there
is one important exception to this rule. The river Amoor, or Sagalin, takes its rise
from numerous branches along the Kinkow mountains, not far from Kiachta and
Maimaichis, the two places at which trade is carried on with Russia, and after
taking a tortuous course to the northward, it receives a very large branch, called the
Schilka, which rises <i>within</i> the Russian frontier in the Baikal mountains, and at
length, after traversing the whole of Mantchouria, empties itself into the sea of
Okotsk, not far from the Russian frontier. The caravans from Kiachta have to
cross most of the numerous branches of this river on their way to Pekin.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Although the Tartar troops had proved themselves a formidable
enemy at Chin-keang-foo, and the loss sustained on
our side had been much greater than in any previous encounter,
a far more dangerous enemy soon began to show itself.
Cholera and low marsh fever now made their appearance, and
carried off a great many men, particularly among the new
comers. The 98th regiment, recently arrived from England,
suffered perhaps more severely than the rest; but, in reality,
every ship, whether a man-of-war, or belonging to the transport
service, had numerous sick on board; and some of the
transport ships were at length scarcely manageable, owing to
the shortness of hands. Nor was the sickness limited to one
part of the river more than another; for the North Star, and
the French frigate, Erigone, which were at anchor at Woosung,
were quite as much afflicted by it as the rest of the squadron
higher up the river. Nor did it begin to diminish until cool
weather set in, and the fleet gradually withdrew out of the
river, after the peace. Many a brave man, too, suffered from
its effects for months after leaving the country; and the officers
were not more exempt than the men.</p>

<p>We may next proceed to inquire what was being done elsewhere
by the naval branch of the expedition, particularly by
the advanced squadron higher up the river, during these operations
at Chin-keang-foo. The great object in view was to
stop the entire trade through that part of the country, which,
having numerous branches of the Grand Canal passing through
it, or at all events being intersected by several canals having
communications with the great one, may be considered as a
centre of commercial intercourse with some of the most important
provinces of China. The annual grain-junks had
already passed up the canal towards Pekin; but the importance
of this great commercial highway (if a canal may so be
called in a country where the only means of transport is by
water) may be estimated from the fact, that in the course
even of a few days no less than seven hundred trading-junks
were stopped; by which means no less panic was created
throughout the country, far and near, than by the successes
of our arms.</p>

<p>There are at least three principal communications between
the Yangtze-Keang and the southern portion of the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Canal, of which, perhaps, the largest passes along the western
side of the walls of Chin-keang-foo, through the suburbs of
that city. It runs very near the west and south gates, where
it is crossed by stone bridges, which, of course, impede the
navigation for large junks. In its narrowest part, where it is
contracted by stone buttresses, it is about twenty feet broad; but,
in other parts, it varies from seventy to eighty feet in breadth,
with very high, steep banks, and with a depth of water varying
from nine to fifteen feet. These observations were made by
Captain Grey, of the Endymion.</p>

<p>The communications on the northern side of the Yangtze-Keang
are much more numerous, and the main canal becomes
much larger and finer. The principal branch of communication
opens about a mile above Golden Island; but there are,
in fact, so many openings, and such numerous cross-lines
running from one branch to the other, that the whole of this
part of the country resembles a network of water-courses. It
is in reality, so little above the level of the river, that it is
entirely laid out in paddy-swamps, which are only separated
from the various canals by embankments artificially made, and
which form the only roads or footways.</p>

<p>The main canal itself, on that side, varies from eighty to
one hundred yards in width, and has a fine towing-path,
running along upon the top of the embankment by which its
waters are confined. A few junks had been sunk at its
entrance, and barriers had also been formed in other branches,
in order to impede the navigation, in case our small steamers
should attempt to ascend them. At the time our forces were
in the neighbourhood, the waters were evidently much higher
than usual; the paddy-fields were deeply inundated, although
the rice was being cut; and some of the villages and courts of
the joss-houses were flooded. Shortly afterwards, while our
squadron was lying off Nankin, the river overflowed its banks
so extensively, that the Chinamen were obliged to move about
in boats from house to house in the suburbs; and great distress
arose, both from this cause, and from the entire stoppage
of trade in the river.</p>

<p>A country so subject to inundations, and intersected as it is
by canals in all directions, cannot but be at times extremely
unhealthy; and it is not to be wondered at that sickness
should have broken out extensively, among a body of foreigners
long confined on board ship. We shall presently allude
to the sickness prevailing among the Chinese themselves in
the neighbourhood of Nankin, which may, in some degree,
account for the great falling off in its population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>From what has been said of the numerous openings and
communications of the Grand Canal, it is evident that it would
require a considerable force to establish an efficient blockade.
But not only was it necessary to stop the trade, but also to take
measures, at the same time, to prevent the panic among the
people from reaching such a pitch as to drive them away from
their homes, and leave the country at the mercy of the rabble,
and of the lawless plunderers who flock into the towns from
all parts, causing uneasiness even to the government.</p>

<p>The Blonde and Modeste, together with the Proserpine,
were placed so as to blockade the two principal entrances of
the canal immediately above Chin-keang-foo, two or three days
before the town was taken; while the Nemesis and the Queen
steamers, having the Plenipotentiary and Captain Bourchier
on board, proceeded some miles higher up the river, until they
suddenly discovered a large fleet of not less than three
hundred trading-junks. These were all ordered to drop down
immediately to Chin-keang, where they could more easily be
prevented from making their escape. A number of papers
written in Chinese were distributed among the captains of the
junks, telling them that no harm would be done to them, but
their vessels must be detained. The Plenipotentiary immediately
returned to Chin-keang-foo, and the Nemesis was left
to hasten the departure of the junks, which were made to get
under way at once. A grand scene of confusion followed, as
they were crowded together, and all were glad to be allowed to
get away from the steamer without molestation. They were
afterwards brought-to, in one of the branches of the southern
canal, just above Golden Island, and, for some time, were
under the charge of the Proserpine steamer, Commander
Hough.</p>

<p>A few miles up the branch of the canal near the mouth of
which this large fleet of junks was discovered, was situated
the third-class town called Esching, distant about twelve or
fourteen miles from Chin-keang. The approach of the
Nemesis, and the detention of the junks, caused so much consternation,
that in the evening a respectably-dressed Chinaman,
who, from the authority he was afterwards found to possess,
must have been a mandarin of some rank, came down to the
steamer, bringing a few trifling presents of tea &amp;c., as a
means of introduction. His object evidently was to ascertain
whether there was any intention of taking possession of the
town; and, if so, to endeavour to avert the calamity by the
offer of a ransom.</p>

<p>Supplies of fresh provisions were at this time greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
wanted in the fleet. Many ships, particularly transports, had
not been able to procure fresh meat or vegetables for a considerable
time, and the sick were, consequently, deprived of
what was most essential to their recovery. This opportunity
of procuring supplies was not to be neglected. The Chinese
gentleman and his attendants were conducted over every part of
the steamer, with which they were evidently much surprised, but
above all with the engines. He was soon made to understand
that if he promised to send down abundant supplies, all of
which would be equitably paid for, no harm whatever would
be done to the town or its inhabitants; but that no trading-junks
could on any account be permitted to pass up the river,
or through that branch of the canal.</p>

<p>A demand for twenty bullocks was made, and they were to
be delivered on the following day. This was declared to be
impossible&mdash;so many could not be found; however, he was
quietly told that they <i>must</i> be forthcoming, and that ten dollars
would be paid for each of them. Late in the evening the
party of Chinamen returned to the town, apparently quite
satisfied with the civility they had received, and equally convinced
of the formidable character of their new visiter.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the 19th, the same people again
came on board very early, bringing with them vegetables and
fruit, and remained some hours, while the Nemesis was chasing
the junks, which were continually coming into view as she proceeded,
and were naturally trying to make their escape. There
were two interpreters (Chinamen from Canton) on board, who
hailed them to bring-to, telling them that they would receive
no molestation if they went quietly <i>down</i> the river. But
some of them continued to persevere in their attempt to
escape, and, when two shots across their bows failed to bring
them to, a third was invariably fired into them, which soon
had the desired effect. One or two Congreve rockets frightened
them still more, and at last they were all brought-to in
great consternation. The Chinese visiters, who were on board
all this time, were perfectly astonished and bewildered, but
were not prevented from making a good breakfast, nevertheless.</p>

<p>A short distance further up the river, they fell in with
several junks laden with coal, but abandoned by their crews.
Some of them were soon driven on shore at different points,
where they could not easily be got off, in order to serve as
coal depôts for the steamer, and one of the largest of them was
lashed alongside and taken in tow, while the Nemesis still
continued her pursuit of the other junks up the river; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
part of her crew being occupied in "coaling" from the junk,
and the other at quarters, occasionally firing a shot across the
bows of any junk that refused to bring-to.</p>

<p>It is here worth while to remark that coal is found in great
abundance in China. Indeed, it is difficult to say what is <i>not</i>
found there: gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, coal, in short, all
that is most requisite for a commercial and manufacturing
people. Coal is known to exist in abundance in the gulf of
Pechelee; it is found in the province of Che-Keang, and in
almost every town visited by the expedition it was exposed
for sale in greater or less quantity. At Nankin, immense
heaps of it were found stored up by the river side, and divided
into three qualities, separated from each other. That which
answered best for steaming purposes had a less promising
appearance than the other qualities. It looked slaty, but was
found to burn better than the Indian coal, and our steamers
all found it to answer well. Probably, if the mines were
worked to a greater depth, a better description of coal would
be found.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>About a mile and a half above the lower branch of the canal
leading up to Eshing, another larger branch was discovered,
which joined the first one a little below the town. On the
evening of the 19th, the Dido and Childers arrived, and joined
the Nemesis; the former, commanded by the Honourable
Captain Keppel, who was now the senior officer, was stationed
off the upper branch, while the latter blockaded the lower one.
Captain Hall immediately presented to Captain Keppel the
Chinese gentleman, or, in reality, mandarin, who had hitherto
been so polite and attentive; and the assurances previously
given were reiterated, that no harm would be done to the town
or the neighbouring country, if abundant supplies were brought
down. The same evening they went up the canal in three
boats to the town, where they were very politely received by
the same Chinaman, who appeared to possess great authority
over the people, who obeyed every direction he gave. At first
they looked on in half stupid wonder, but were evidently reassured
when they were told that nothing would be demanded
but supplies of meat and vegetables.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>
<p>On the following day, the Chinaman again came down to
the Nemesis, bringing with him all the gentlemen of his
family, in order to show his confidence, and at the same time
invited Captain Keppel and other officers to visit him at his
house in the city, and proposed to give them an entertainment
at a joss-house ashore. He even hinted that he would <i>introduce
them to his wife</i>.</p>

<p>Arrangements were now made for establishing a regular
market in the courtyard of the large joss-house, which stood
close to the landing-place at the mouth of the canal. The
man scrupulously kept his word, supplies in great abundance
of every description were brought down for sale, and the sight
of dollars soon overcame all the Chinamen's fears. In fact,
they reaped a good harvest. These supplies were all sent
down to the fleet at Chin-keang as fast as they could be procured,
Chinese boats or small junks being employed to convey
them, escorted by a boat alternately from the Dido and the
Nemesis, to ensure their safe delivery. Such was the result
of conciliating the good-will, and pacifying the fears of the
Chinese.</p>

<p>For a moment the fears of the people were awakened by the
accidental burning of some buildings at the mouth of the
lower branch of the canal, where the Childers was stationed.
But fortunately the Admiral came up in person, on board the
Pluto, in the afternoon, to examine the river, and the assurance
of protection, if abundant supplies were provided,
being circulated among the people by a written paper or chop
in the Chinese character, they resumed their former confidence,
and did not conceal their delight. This was the evening
before Chin-keang was taken.</p>

<p>The next day, the 21st July, the Chinese gentleman and his
attendants, according to previous invitation, came down to
conduct the officers to his house in the city, situated four or
five miles up the canal. It is not a little singular, that while
one party of our countrymen were partaking of Chinese hospitality,
upon the most friendly terms, in the centre of a considerable
town, the rest were engaged in deadly hostility,
fighting for hearth and home, in a city only a few miles distant.
Although the distance from one to the other by the
river cannot be less than twelve or thirteen miles, it must
be very much less in a direct line by land, as the firing was
distinctly heard.</p>

<p>On coming on board to fetch the officers who were invited
to the entertainment at his house, the unhappy Chinaman
burst into a flood of tears, and soon made them understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
that his wife had ran away from him, the moment it was
announced that they were coming to pay her a visit. Probably
tidings had already been brought of the commencement
of the attack upon Chin-keang; nevertheless, on reaching the
town, there were no indications of alarm among the people;
they crowded round in all directions, out of mere curiosity;
the shops were not closed, and business did not appear to be
interrupted.</p>

<p>A proclamation was distributed as the party proceeded,
announcing to the inhabitants that all supplies would be
scrupulously paid for, and that no injury would be done to the
city. The best interpreter was found to be a little Chinese
boy, only ten years old, who had been several months on
board the Nemesis, having been almost adopted by her commander,
after the death of his father, who was killed at Chusan.
In this short time he had picked up English in an astonishing
manner. His extreme youth was a guarantee for his honesty;
and, at last, the Chinese gentleman carried on all his conversation
through this interesting little boy; declaring that
the little follow spoke truth and could be depended on, but
that the two Canton interpreters perverted what was said, by
purposely translating it wrongly, to suit their own purposes,
and with a view to extort money.</p>

<p>The Chinese gentleman's house was situated in the very
heart of the city; it was a very respectable mansion, with
courts and buildings of great extent, ornamented with carved
wood-work, similar to most other respectable houses of its
class. All the relations and friends of the family had been invited
on the occasion, refreshments were handed round, but
no females made their appearance. At length, the master of
the house was resolved to drown his sorrows for the loss of
his wife, by the delicious enjoyment of his opium-pipe, which
soon revived his drooping spirits.</p>

<p>The return of the party through the streets towards the
boats was the occasion of greater movement among the people
than before. As an additional mark of respect, two well-dressed
persons accompanied each of the officers, one on
either side, <i>fanning</i> them as they went, for the day was extremely
sultry. Altogether, it was a most interesting scene.
Another entertainment was also given to them in the joss-house,
at the mouth of the canal, where the market was held;
and, in short, nothing was omitted on the part of the Chinese,
to show their confidence, and their wish to cultivate our good-will.</p>

<p>On the following day, the surveying vessels, Starling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
Plover, and Medusa, having on board the masters of the fleet,
joined the advanced squadron under Captain Keppel,
bringing the first intelligence of the fight of the previous
day.</p>

<p>We must now return for a moment to Chin-Keang, which
we left in the last chapter in the possession of our troops, the
greater part of which were already preparing to move up
towards Nankin. Another attempt was now made by the
Chinese commissioners, Keying and Elepoo, to open negotiations
with the Plenipotentiary; but since they did not even
now produce full authority from the Emperor to treat for
peace, no other than the answer they had previously received
could be given to them.</p>

<p>It has before been mentioned that the Tartar general,
Hailing, when he saw that all was lost, set fire to his house,
and burned himself to death in it. His wife and his grandson
shared the same fate; at least so it would appear from the
orders issued by the Emperor afterwards, whose mandate was
sent to Keying, "that he should despatch messengers to make
diligent search for their bodies, in order that great honours
might be conferred upon them. Such loyalty and devotion
are worthy of the highest praise!" A temple was also ordered
to be erected to his memory, as soon as the war should be
ended, upon which his own name, and also those of his wife
and his grandson, were to be inscribed. Moreover, as soon
as the prescribed period of mourning of one hundred days
should have expired, the whole of his sons and daughters
were to be sought out, and conducted into the imperial presence.
Such, then, are the rewards which the Emperor
holds out to those who put an end to their own lives after a
defeat.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Gough, finding that it would take a much larger
body of men to garrison the town than could be spared from
his small force, and that, moreover, it could scarcely be considered
habitable during the great heat, on account of the
horrible stench proceeding from the dead bodies of the fallen
Tartars, (principally by their own hands,) and from the stagnant
water in the smaller canals, determined merely to occupy
the heights commanding the city towards its north-eastern
angle. Major-General Schoedde's brigade was to be left in
charge of the place, together with a detachment of artillery. In
order to establish a direct communication between the heights
and the city on that side, a portion of the wall was blown in,
(with very large charges of Chinese powder,) and the rubbish
removed, so as to leave a large, free opening into the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
The whole line of parapet on that side was also demolished.
Another hill commanding the southern entrance to the Grand
Canal was also to be occupied. The troops left behind were
quite sufficient to hold these positions against any force the
Chinese could bring against them after their late defeat. It
consisted of the 55th regiment, and one company of the 98th,
with the 2nd and 6th M.N.I., with artillery and sappers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious object discovered at Chin-keang,
and which has excited many ingenious speculations as to the
ancient progress of the Chinese in many of the useful arts,
was a small pagoda <i>made entirely of cast iron</i>. Some have
called it Gutzlaff's Pagoda, for he is said to have been the
first to find it out; and it excited so much attention, that the
question was at one time mooted, as to the possibility of taking
it to pieces, and conveying it to England, as a remarkable
specimen of Chinese antiquity. Nor would this have been at
all impossible; for, although it had seven stories, it was altogether
little more than thirty feet high, and each story was
cast in separate pieces. It was of an octagonal shape, and
had originally been ornamented in high relief on every side,
though the lapse of ages had much defaced the ornaments.
It was calculated by Mr. Gutzlaff, that this remarkable
structure must be at least <i>twelve hundred years old</i>, judging
from the characters still found upon it. Whatever its age
may be, there can be no question that it proves the Chinese
were acquainted with the art of casting large masses of iron,
and of using them both for solidity and for ornament, centuries
before it was adopted in Europe.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August, the preparations were all completed
for the advance of the forces upon Nankin, the surveying
vessels having already preceded the squadron. The principal
difficulty which remained to be overcome was the great force
of the current, which it required a strong favourable wind to
enable the ships to stem. Indeed, without the assistance of
steamers, it is doubtful whether all the ships could have got
up. On the 5th, the General reached Nankin in the Marion
transport, towed by the Queen steamer, having the Plenipotentiary
on board.</p>

<p>On the following day, the Admiral got up in the Cornwallis,
with some other vessels, but the whole of the squadron did
not join until the 9th. The Nemesis attended a part of the
fleet, to render assistance wherever it was most required, particularly
in getting off the transports which took the ground,
a service requiring no little judgment and perseverance. Just
below Nankin the river takes a very considerable bend, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
former course having been nearly east and west, while it now
turns nearly due south until it has passed Nankin. There is,
however, a cut, or canal, or creek, at all events, a water passage,
which cuts off this bend, of course materially shortening
the distance, which from point to point is about ten miles
round, and only six miles by the cut. The passage, however,
is narrow; but the Nemesis, taking in tow one of the transports,
found her way safely through it.</p>

<p>On the 10th, the proper positions were assigned to the
ships, in case it should be necessary to bombard the city.
The nearest point of the walls to the river was about seven
hundred yards, and the nearest gate about one thousand.
The Cornwallis, Blonde, and heavy steamers were placed so
as to breach the walls, if required.</p>

<p>Already before leaving Chin-keang, a regular summons had
been sent up to Nankin, addressed to New Kien, the viceroy
of the province. It was hoped that by these means bloodshed
might be avoided. Immediately the forces arrived before the
city, it was determined that the troops should be landed without
delay, with a view to make a strong demonstration against
the city, and there was some reason to think that this would
be sufficient to decide the wavering councils of the Chinese,
without further resort to arms; and, at all events, it was requisite
to support our demands by a show of the means of
enforcing them.</p>

<p>A memorial was intercepted, addressed to the Emperor by
the Tartar general commanding at Nankin, boldly announcing
the defeat and dispersion of the Chinese troops, and the imminent
danger even of Nankin itself. It was evident that great
alarm was felt, and that a general desire to stay hostilities had
got the better of all their hatred of the foreigners. The entire
stoppage of the trade of that part of the empire, and the distress
resulting from it, tended very materially to promote this
desirable object.</p>

<p>The venerable Elepoo had arrived at Nankin nearly at the
same time with Sir Henry Pottinger; and very soon afterwards,
Keying, the other imperial commissioner, a member of
the imperial house sent expressly from Pekin, joined his colleague.
Various messages and writings now passed between
the governor of Nankin, New Kien, and the Plenipotentiary,
in which, among other things, a heavy ransom was offered for
the city. In short, the grand effort of the Chinese authorities
was to gain time, to defer the evil hour of absolute concession
to our demands, and to put us off in some way or other for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the moment, as they had formerly done at Canton, without
committing themselves to a final settlement of affairs.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they had a man of determined energy and
statesmanlike qualities to deal with, in Sir Henry Pottinger;
one who took a broad, defined view of all the questions involved,
and who would not swerve for a moment from what
he considered just demands and capable of being enforced.
All the astute efforts of the Chinese to temporize, to <i>shirk</i> the
main question, to save their own dignity, and to withhold what
was due to that of their opponents, were promptly and energetically
met. With all the honour which we justly accord to
the naval and military operations of the war, with all due consideration
for the diplomatic difficulties which had hitherto
beset our efforts to make an equitable adjustment of the pending
disputes, we cannot but concede to Sir Henry Pottinger
the well-earned palm of praise and eminence for the consummate
tact and skill with which he conducted the difficult negotiations
at Nankin to a speedy and successful issue.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, nor indeed would it be an easy matter
even for one initiated into the secrets of the diplomatic correspondence
which followed, to describe all the attempts at
evasion which were made by the Chinese, and the cunning
with which they at first endeavoured to arrogate to their
Emperor and to themselves superior titles of distinction and
precedence. Even when it was announced that the high
commissioners, Elepoo and Keying, had arrived, with full
powers under the imperial pencil to treat upon every subject,
it was no easy task to bring them to straightforward matters
of business, or to force them to produce the actual instrument
of authority which they professed to possess. The landing of
the troops, however, and the earnest preparations which were
made for storming the city, tended to bring them speedily to
their senses.</p>

<p>After deducting the garrison left at Chin-keang, and the
sick which remained on board the transports, the actual force
at Sir Hugh Gough's disposal for the attack of the city
amounted to about three thousand four hundred men, exclusive
of the officers; a force sufficient for the easy attainment
of the object itself, but very small indeed for the duties likely
to be required of it, when once in possession of the city.
Sickness would very soon have greatly reduced the number of
effective men; and although they would, in case of need, have
received accessions, by the addition of the marines and seamen
of the squadron, still there were even at that time so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
many sick on board the ships, that it would have been very
difficult to make any calculation as to the number which would
have remained fit for service at the end of a couple of months.
The waters of the river were exceedingly high; in many parts
the banks were overflowed in the neighbourhood of the city,
and fever and cholera were the most dangerous enemies to be
apprehended. In every point of view, it is a matter of the
greatest congratulation, not only that the war was so soon
brought to a close, but even that our forces were not detained
for any great length of time at Nankin.</p>

<p>The position of Nankin is evidently well chosen for that of
a great capital; but the city is greatly fallen from its ancient
importance and extent. There are remains of an ancient or
outer wall, which can be traced over hill and dale for a distance
of not less than thirty-five miles. The Chinese have a
saying, that if two horsemen start at daybreak from any given
point of the walls, in opposite directions, and gallop round
the walls of the city, they will not meet until sunset. But this
must be a regular <i>Chinese</i> gallop, and not exactly that of an
English hunter. How much of this immense space was in
ancient times occupied by houses, it would be difficult to determine.
The walls of the present city are not nearly of so
great an extent; and of the actual space enclosed within them,
a very small portion indeed, perhaps not exceeding an eighth
part, is occupied by the actual town.</p>

<p>Here again, as at Chin-keang and Chapoo, the Tartar city
is separated from the Chinese part of it by a wall and gates
running across it;&mdash;so carefully have the conquerors preserved
their broad line of distinction, in person, habits, mode
of life, and privileges, even in the ancient capital of the empire.</p>

<p>The great extent of the walls, even in the present day, rendered
the city ill calculated for defence, independently even of
its being commanded by hills, particularly on its eastern side.
The principal of these was called the Chungshan hill, the base
of which commanded the ramparts, and from the summit of
which there was a magnificent prospect over the whole surrounding
country, including the city itself. It was principally
from this, the eastern side, that the chief attack was to have
been made, had it been necessary to resort to extremities.
There were three gates in that face of the walls, which run
very irregularly, and towards the river are almost inaccessible,
owing to the swampy nature of the ground; a considerable
lake occupies the space between two of the gates. The latter
are, however, approached by good causeways, by which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
might easily have been threatened, while the real attack would
have been made higher up, under cover of the guns planted
upon the slope of the Chungshan hill.</p>

<p>The greater part of the troops were landed at a village about
four or five miles up the creek or short cut before described,
because there were good causeways leading directly from that
point towards the city. The Nemesis was able to land at one
time not less than a thousand men, and, in case of absolute
necessity, could have contrived to carry at least a hundred and
fifty more.</p>

<p>On the opposite or western side of the city, there was a large
canal running from the river directly up under the walls, and
serving to strengthen the approaches to them on that side.
The mouth of this canal was completely stopped up by very
strong rafts, firmly secured. They were, moreover, constructed
in such a manner that there were, in fact, a succession of rafts,
one above the other. On removing the upper tier, another
lower one immediately rose to the surface; and, as they were
made of stout timbers, well secured together, they effectually
prevented our boats from getting up the canal. Upon the
top of the rafts, little huts had even been erected, in which a
few poor fellows were living, but apparently not with any purpose
of defence.</p>

<p>At daylight, on the 14th, the attack was ordered to be made
upon the city, all being now in readiness, and the guns in
position. Due warning was finally given to the commissioners,
that nothing could delay or suspend the attack except the
production of the actual document itself, of the contents of
which they had hitherto only given a very partial account. It
was not until past midnight, <i>scarcely more than three hours</i>
before the artillery would have opened, and the assault have
taken place, that the commissioners at length yielded, and
sent a letter, addressed to Sir Henry Pottinger, promising the
production of the all-important document at a meeting to be
arranged for the morning, and entreating that hostilities might
at least be delayed until that time.</p>

<p>This was a moment of intense excitement to all who were
acquainted with the circumstances. The attack was of course
delayed, but it was doubted by many whether some new pretext
would not still be found to delay or to break off the
negotiations, and render the capture of the city inevitable.
However, the proposed meeting did take place at a temple on
shore, in the southern suburbs of the city, near the canal; and
at length, with great form and ceremony, the emperor's commission
was produced, and carefully examined by Mr. Morrison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
in the presence of Major Malcolm; and, at the same
time, Sir Henry Pottinger's patent was likewise produced, and
translated to the deputies who attended for the purpose on
the part of the imperial commissioners.</p>

<p>As yet, no personal interview had taken place between Sir
Henry and the commissioners. Matters now proceeded satisfactorily.
It was evident that the Chinese were at length prepared
to yield anything we might demand; their anxiety to
put an end to the blockade of the river and the canal was not
concealed, and it was said to be freely admitted that the
people were in the greatest distress.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards&mdash;viz., on the 17th, it was announced
by Sir Henry Pottinger to the naval and military commanders-in-chief,
that the negotiations had arrived at that stage which
authorized him to beg that hostilities might be considered
suspended. Some little delay was necessarily occasioned, by
the time required, and the difficulty experienced, in translating
the lengthened correspondence which took place. The distance,
moreover, of the city from the ships, and the time
necessary to receive and transmit the communications and
their replies, tended to prolong the proceedings. Even in
three days, however, the treaty was actually drafted in English
and Chinese, (the latter a task of extreme difficulty, from the
precision of terms necessary,) and the commissioners acceded
to the whole tenour and forms of a document of incalculable
importance, not only to England and the other nations of
Europe, but to the whole future welfare and progress of the
Chinese empire.</p>

<p>Many days must have elapsed before the terms of the treaty
could be made known at Pekin, and the assent of the emperor
be received. It might still have been doubted whether, even
in the eleventh hour, the emperor could bring himself to
submit to the hard necessity of accepting terms which he had
hitherto believed himself able rather to dictate to every other
nation, or to accord, as a matter of "especial favour," to submissive
barbarians, than to receive from them as a boon.</p>

<p>The high commissioners, of course, professed to be confident
that all the provisions of the treaty would be assented
to by the emperor. They were extremely anxious to persuade
Sir Henry Pottinger that the ships might safely be withdrawn
from the river <i>at once</i>, even before an answer could be received
from Pekin. Their great anxiety to have the blockade
raised was by no means concealed; but the plenipotentiary
was far too clever a diplomatist to think of foregoing, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
moment, the immense advantage which the position of our
forces already gave him, and the commissioners were distinctly
apprised that everything would still continue to be held in
readiness for the resumption of hostilities, in the event of the
emperor's confirmation of the acts of his commissioners being
withheld.</p>

<p>The report which was sent up to the emperor by the two
high commissioners was certainly remarkable for its clearness
and simplicity, compared with the tone usually adopted in
Chinese documents. Indeed, it has generally been accorded
to Keying, that he was the first high officer who, since the
commencement of the war, had dared to tell the naked truth
to his imperial master.</p>

<p>The time which elapsed between the sending up of the
draft of the treaty for submission to the emperor, and its return
with the imperial assent, was partially occupied by visits
of ceremony between the high commissioners and the British
plenipotentiary. On the 19th, the former paid their first visit
on board the Cornwallis, having been conveyed thither from
the mouth of the canal, on board the little Medusa steamer.
They were received on board by the plenipotentiary, supported
by the admiral and general, and after having partaken of refreshments,
were conducted round the ship, every part of
which they inspected, but without <i>expressing</i> any particular
astonishment, which in China is considered ill bred.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The commissioners were accompanied by New Kien, the
viceroy, and also by the Tartar general.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, the visit was returned by Sir Henry Pottinger,
accompanied by the Commanders-in-chief, and attended
by upwards of a hundred officers in full uniform. They were
escorted by a guard of honour of the grenadiers of the 18th
royal Irish. The place of meeting was at the temple outside
the walls, at which the previous conferences respecting the
production of the imperial commission had been held. It
was an imposing and interesting scene; the number and
variety of the costumes, contrasted with the uniforms of our
officers, and the novelty of the spectacle altogether, could not
fail to make a deep impression upon all present.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 26th, a conference was held <i>within</i> the walls of
Nankin itself, between Sir Henry Pottinger and the commissioners,
and the terms of the treaty were again read and discussed.
Sir Henry was escorted by a guard mounted upon
the Arab horses brought from Madras for the artillery. Little
could have been seen of the city upon this occasion, as the
procession passed directly up to one of the public halls, and
returned by the same route. The bearing of the people was
perfectly quiet and orderly; and the mark of confidence on
both sides shewn by the visit of the commissioners on board
the Cornwallis, and of the plenipotentiary within the walls of
the city, must certainly have tended to increase the mutual
good understanding which it was now so desirable to cultivate.</p>

<p>At length, on the 29th of August, three days after the previous
visit, the emperor's full assent to the provisions of the
treaty having in the meantime arrived, the ceremony of the
actual signature of this most interesting document took place
on board the Cornwallis. Every arrangement was made
which could at all enhance the solemnity of the ceremony;
and even the venerable Elepoo, though sick and very infirm
from age and ill health, allowed himself to be <i>carried</i> on board,
and into the after-cabin, rather than delay for a day the signature
of the treaty.</p>

<p>A great number of officers (all those having a rank equal
to that of a field-officer) were admitted into the after-cabin, in
order to witness the intensely interesting ceremony. Captain
Hall was likewise permitted to be present, as a mark of especial
favour, although not then of the prescribed rank. Just at
the eventful moment, also, Captain Cecille, of the French
frigate Erigone, arrived from Woosung, having made his way
up in a Chinese junk hired for the occasion at Shanghai, and
manned by a picked crew of his own men. He presented
himself uninvited, on board the flag-ship, and almost <i>demanded</i>
to be present. It is said that his reception was not very
cordial.</p>

<p>It was at first feared by many that the Chinese government
would prove itself insincere in its professions, and would probably
seek an early opportunity of nullifying the provisions of
the treaty. By others, it has been thought that even the
people themselves would not only continue their ancient hostility
to foreigners, but might urge, and almost force the
government itself into renewed collision with us&mdash;that, in
fact, nothing short of the capture of Pekin itself, at some
future day, would suffice to humble the nation, and compel
them to hold reluctant intercourse with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>The disturbances which took place at Canton, <i>after</i> the
peace (to be described in the next chapter) gave some colour,
for the moment, to these apprehensions; and the less people
at a distance were acquainted with the origin and nature of
those disturbances, and with the Chinese character generally,
the more readily such apprehensions found credence. In this
respect, I firmly believe that we do the Chinese some injustice;
and I cannot but think that, if further difficulties should
arise, which might lead to a collision much to be deplored,
they will be occasioned rather by some indiscretion, some
want of forbearance, or some undue and unwarranted interference
with the acknowledged rights and customs of the
Chinese, <i>by foreigners themselves</i>, than by violence on the part
of the people, or a wish to annul the provisions of the treaty
on the part of the government. It is only necessary to read
the whole of the published correspondence of Sir Henry Pottinger,
and to look at the scrupulous exactness with which
the Chinese have acted, and, we may add, the readiness with
which they have met Sir Henry's wishes, to be convinced that
it only requires judgment, forbearance, and strict propriety on
our part, not only to continue, but even to <i>increase</i>, the good
understanding which already exists.</p>

<p>The regulations already published by Sir Henry Pottinger,
respecting the future trade, will go far to prevent any <i>wilful</i>
misunderstanding. But if we wish to extend our intercourse,
and to benefit by increased good-will and confidence, we must
win it from the Chinese by cultivating their good feelings, not
by offending their prejudices, and by treating them with consideration,
firmness, and <i>scrupulous honesty</i>.</p>

<p>The consuls at the five ports will have arduous and responsible
duties to perform, and very much must depend upon
their tact and judgment. The Chinese are not only a prejudiced,
but a <i>timid</i> people; they require to be led rather by
good management and scrupulous faith, than to be irritated
by overbearing manner, or forced into dishonesty by the constant
suspicion of it. During the existence of the company's
charter, the mark of the company was considered by the
Chinese as an unfailing guarantee of the genuine character
and quality of the articles, in accordance with the description
given of them. The mark no longer exists, and the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
merchants have not that implicit faith in the written description
of our goods which they formerly had. It is impossible
to be too scrupulous in maintaining our character for strict
integrity and fair dealing; and it is to be hoped that these
will be kept strictly in view, more especially in the new ports
just opened to us.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> Dr. Smith makes particular mention of coal as being commonly seen in China
during Lord Macartney's embassy. Pits of coal were found near the Poyang lake
above Nankin. He says that the coal found in the province of Pechelee was a
species of graphite; that which was seen near the Yangtze river was like Kennel
coal, and that observed near the Poyang lake resembled covey coal. Other coal
found at Chow-chow-foo contained much sulphur, and was used in the manufacture
of sulphate of iron in the neighbourhood of that city.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> I have heard it said by some who were present on this occasion, that the commissioners
appeared more struck with the fact of <i>boys</i>, midshipmen, wearing uniform,
and learning the art of war so young, than with anything else. I think it was
Elepoo who had the curiosity to examine the dress of one of the youngsters; as
much as to say, that he would be much better at school, imbibing the "doctrines of
pure reason," than learning how to fight so young, on board a man-of-war. The
same remark had also been made, on another occasion, by Keshen, at Canton,
respecting the young Mr. Gray; and, I believe, a remark very much like it, was
made by the grandfather of the present Emperor, to Sir George Staunton, who was
then a boy.</p></div></div>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>The two most interesting objects which deserve attention
outside the walls of Nankin are, the famous porcelain tower,
or pagoda, and the tombs of the kings of the ancient Chinese
dynasty. Of the former it would be extremely difficult to give
such a description as would convey to the reader's mind an
accurate idea of its peculiar structure and character. It stands
pre-eminent above all other similar buildings in China for its
completeness and elegance, the quality of the material of
which it is built, or rather with which it is faced over&mdash;namely,
variously coloured porcelain bricks, highly glazed;
and for the quantity of gilding, and particularly of gilt images,
with which its interior is embellished.</p>

<p>The building is of an octagonal shape, about two hundred
feet high, divided into nine stories. The circumference of the
lower story is one hundred and twenty feet, so that each face
must measure about fifteen feet; but this measurement decreases
as you ascend, although each story is of equal height.
Its base rests upon a solid foundation of brickwork, raised
about ten feet above the ground, and you ascend to the
entrance of the tower by a flight of twelve steps. Its face is
covered with slabs of glazed porcelain of various colours,
principally green, red, yellow, and white; but the whole
building is not, by any means, constructed with porcelain.
At every story there is a projecting roof, covered with green-glazed
tiles, and from each of its eight corners is suspended
a small bell.</p>

<p>The effect of this building, when viewed from a moderate
distance, is imposing, no less from the novelty than the peculiarity
of its appearance. You ascend to the top of it by
one hundred and ninety steps, leading through the different
compartments, but they are not all in very good repair. The
interior of each story appears at first view striking, but is
rather gaudy than elegant, being filled with an immense
number of little gilded images, placed in niches, in each of
the compartments, between the windows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451</a></span></p>

<p>The view from the summit of this temple amply compensates
you for all the trouble of reaching it, and for any little
disappointment that may have been felt at the appearance of
the interior of the building. The property extends over an
area of nearly thirty miles, and a great part of this is enclosed
within the ruins of a dilapidated wall. The country is beautifully
diversified by hill and dale, and houses and cultivated
grounds; yet, in some parts, it looks almost deserted. Yet
it cannot be viewed without great interest, not only from the
appearance of the country, but from the associations connected
with the locality, and with the tower itself. This latter is said
to have cost an immense sum of money (seven or eight
hundred thousand pounds), and to have occupied nineteen
years in its completion.</p>

<p>A not unnatural desire to possess specimens or relics, as
mementos of the first, and probably the last, visit to the ancient
capital of the empire, led to a few instances of defacement
and injury to some parts of the building, and to many
of the figures within it. But the complaints made upon the
subject afterwards by the head priest of the tower, or of the
monastery attached to it, seem to have been a good deal
exaggerated, probably in the hope of obtaining handsome
compensation. It was notorious that a great part of the
specimens which were carried away were actually sold to visitors
by the priests themselves. A complaint, however, was
made upon the subject to Sir Henry Pottinger, and at his
request measures were adopted to prevent any recurrence of
the violence; and, indeed, with the laudable object of encouraging
a good understanding with the Chinese, and of doing
what, under the circumstances, appeared to be an act of justice,
a considerable sum of money was paid over to the chief priest,
or abbot, of the monastery, to be applied to the restoration
and decoration of the building. It much exceeded the actual
value of the damage done.</p>

<p>Another object of very great interest, which engaged attention
at Nankin, was the large and extremely ancient cemetery,
which apparently, without sufficiently well-ascertained grounds,
came to be called the Tombs of the Kings, supposed to be of
the Ming dynasty. They were situated on the slope of the
hills, at no great distance from the principal gate of the city,
at the extremity of a fine paved road.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, still more curious is the avenue of gigantic
figures, most of them hewn from a solid piece of stone, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
leads up towards the tombs. Nothing else of the kind was
seen in China, and they bore all the appearance of extreme
antiquity; the grass grew very high among them, and served
to conceal the fragments of some which had been broken.
The engraving, which forms the frontispiece to this volume,
will convey a better idea of them than any written description.
It is taken from an admirable sketch, drawn on the spot, by
Captain Watson, R.N., C.B. The figures bear the appearance
of gigantic warriors, cased in a kind of armour, standing on
either side of the road, across which, at intervals, large stone
tablets are extended, supported by large blocks of stone in
place of pillars, such as are frequently seen on the roads leading
to temples in China, and occasionally across the streets,
erected in honour of particular individuals.</p>

<p>In the drawing are represented a number of colossal figures
of horses, elephants, zebras, and other animals, rudely, executed,
and placed without any distinct arrangement. Properly
speaking, they are situated at a considerable distance from the
alley of giants, but have been introduced to give an effective
representation of the whole. There is something peculiarly
Egyptian in the appearance of them all, and one could rather
imagine that the scene was laid in the vicinity of Thebes than
under the walls of Nankin. It tends, in some measure, to
strengthen the opinion of those who have endeavoured to
trace a connexion between China and Egypt, at a very remote
period of their history.</p>

<p>Little remains to be said concerning the rest of the short
period of the detention of our forces at Nankin. On the 15th
of September, the Emperor's positive assent to the treaty,
signed by his commissioners, on the 29th of August, was
received at Nankin.</p>

<p>All were now anxious to quit the river without delay, in
which so many brave men had already found a grave, through
sickness. Every ship was full of invalids; in many of them
full one-third of the crew were unable to work, and in some
even more. The officers appeared to suffer equally with the
men; and on this account some of the transports were in a
pitiable condition. The recovery of the men was extremely
slow, and, even after the fever was apparently cured, relapses
were very frequent. There are no means, however, of ascertaining
the actual number of deaths which occurred, but in
some ships they were numerous. Among the troops, the
98th regiment and the Bengal Volunteers suffered the most;
but the latter were affected more by their confinement on
board ship, and by the voluntary starvation to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
submitted, on account of the prejudices of their religion, than
by the mere effect of climate. They principally suffered from
dysentery, occasioned by their abstinence from proper food.
Most of them being Rajpoots, high caste Hindoos, they were
prohibited by their superstition from eating any food cooked
on board ship. Dry rice and gram (a shrivelled pea, of which
sheep and cattle are very fond) constituted almost the only
food they would eat, and edible tobacco their only luxury.
Medicine could afford little aid to men under these circumstances;
and they preferred death to the violation of their
religious feelings; indeed, it was not until the survivors
reached Hong-Kong, and were sent ashore to live in tents,
in order to be able to cook proper food for themselves, that
they began to recover strength enough to enable them to
support the remainder of the voyage to Calcutta.</p>

<p>While the Hindoos suffered thus severely, the few Mohammedans
who were in the regiment escaped almost without sickness,
and there was scarcely a death amongst them. A finer
regiment than the Bengal Volunteers, when they arrived in
China only a few weeks before, nine hundred strong, could
hardly be seen. They were even seven hundred and fifty
strong when they landed at Nankin, after having been in
action at Chin-Keang; and yet, when the regiment arrived in
Calcutta, there were less than four hundred survivors. Indeed,
there were little more than three hundred upon the field
when they were reviewed at Barrackpore, with the rest of the
garrison, by Sir Hugh Gough.</p>

<p>Before leaving Nankin, the ceremony of conferring the order
of the Grand Cross of the Bath upon Sir Hugh Gough was
performed on board the Cornwallis, with all the attendant
marks of honour. As it was directed that it should take place
in the most public manner possible, the high Chinese officers
were invited to attend, and every preparation was made to
give eclât to the proceedings. Very few of the Chinese came
to witness it, but a few were sufficient to make known to their
countrymen generally, that great honours were being conferred
upon the English general, for his successes against their best
troops.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, the different transports and
ships of war began to move down the river. The steamers
were now almost entirely supplied with Nankin coal, immense
heaps of which were found regularly stored up along the banks
of the river, nearly in front of the city.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>The descent of the river was in some respects more difficult
for the squadron than the ascent, particularly as the buoys,
which had been laid down to mark the channel, had been removed
by the Chinese in the interim. Under these circumstances,
and in the absence of proper charts of the river, it is
highly creditable to the transports that they all succeeded in
getting down without any serious accident. Steamers generally
went ahead, and gave the soundings by signal, notwithstanding
which, most of the ships got aground several times.
The weather was now very unsettled and hazy, as the north-east
monsoon was just setting in, and this added, of course, to
the difficulty.</p>

<p>The plenipotentiary, together with the Admiral and General,
paid a visit to Shanghai, on their arrival at Woosung, and the
arrangements respecting the ransom of the town, which was
to be considered as part of the money paid under the terms of
the treaty, were now completed, and the money was shipped;
by this payment, the first instalment of 6,000,000 dollars was
completed.</p>

<p>At the end of October the whole of the fleet had finally
quitted the Yangtze Keang, and were assembled in the beautiful
harbours of Chusan. I never remember to have witnessed
so picturesque and striking a scene as was there presented
to view. Both the outer and inner harbours were
crowded with men-of-war, transports, and steamers.</p>

<p>About the middle of November, nearly all our ships had
reassembled at Hong-Kong. It was a most animated and
bustling scene, and during the two or three weeks in which
our forces were detained there, the Chinese reaped a rich harvest
from the sale of Chinese manufactures and curiosities,
which were eagerly sought for.</p>

<p>From various causes, our forces were detained at Hong-Kong
longer than had been expected, and in some respects it
happened fortunately, although the weather had become excessively
cold and trying for the men. On the 7th of December
disturbances took place at Canton, which resulted in the total
destruction of the old company's factory, the Dutch factory,
(occupied by American merchants,) and the adjacent extensive
buildings, called the Creek Hong. As this event produced
great alarm in the minds of the foreign residents in China, and
even produced an impression on the minds of mercantile
people at a distance, who were, in consequence, led to doubt
the practicability of maintaining peaceable relations with the
Chinese for any length of time, some few details will be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>It is proper to remark that the community of Canton differs
in many respects from that of any other part of China. Long
accustomed to a profitable intercourse with foreigners, and
encouraged by their government to look upon them as an inferior,
or, at all events, a less favoured race, arrogant also in
proportion to their ignorance, they could not reconcile to
themselves the advantageous terms which had been exacted as
the price of peace from the Emperor; and forgetting the
numerous lessons they had been taught in the Canton river,
they believed they could still have succeeded against the
foreigner, had their professed patriotism been appealed to,
and their proud spirit permitted to pour forth its vengeance.</p>

<p>It is also to be remembered that, in a large commercial city
like Canton, a great number of bad and discontented characters
are collected from all quarters. Its reputation for wealth
made it a desirable field for the adventurer, while the prospect
of the loss of a great portion of its trade served to produce a
general discontent among the residents. Every great change,
however, is commonly attended with some difficulty at first,
nor was it likely that the people of Canton could readily forget
the day when our troops dictated terms for the ransom of the
city, from the heights above it. Moreover, a great part of
them really believed that they had been <i>betrayed</i>, and that
treachery or bribery had been used rather to favour <i>us</i> than to
spare the city; while they scarcely doubted that the large
bodies of militia, or self-styled patriots, who continued to
hover about the rear of Sir Hugh Gough's army while upon
the heights, would have sufficed to have driven him back
again to his ships.</p>

<p>For some days previous to the actual disturbances, there
had been rumours of an intended rising against the English.
Hints were given by some of the people of the establishments
belonging to the Hong merchants, that something unusual
would happen, and, in fact, that people were combining
together for no good ostensible purpose. I happened to be at
Canton at the time, and could not help noticing the eagerness
with which the crowds of passers-by were reading anonymous
placards pasted upon the walls, in the narrow streets at the
back of the Factories. These documents professed to publish
the sentiments of the patriotic gentry and people belonging
to the neighbourhood of Canton. They misstated the terms
of the treaty, and asserted the belief, that foreigners were hereafter
coming to build houses for themselves at Canton, and to
reside there <i>with their families</i>. This was, in fact, the great
object of their dread, or rather, this was the principal argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
they used to endeavour to rouse the people generally to resist,
"and not to allow a single foreigner to remain."</p>

<p>The promiscuous <i>residence</i> of foreigners in China was certainly
never contemplated by the terms of the treaty; though
a support was given to this supposition of the Chinese, by the
appearance of three or four English ladies (wives of captains
of ships at Whampoa) in the streets of Canton.</p>

<p>I remember well what a sensation it created, when these
ladies were seen proceeding up China Street, accompanied by
their children, (and, of course, by their husbands.) The
novelty of their dress and personal appearance was the least
part of the business. It was an infraction of all the established
usages of the Chinese; for not only had no foreign ladies
been hitherto seen in the streets, but not even Chinese ladies
are ever to be seen in public, except in sedan-chairs. On
this occasion, the people offered neither violence nor insult,
and, indeed, a few policemen were stationed close to the Factories,
to prevent the pressure of the crowd. In the evening
they embarked again in their boats, and proceeded down the
river.</p>

<p>There is no question that this little incident had a very bad
effect upon the feelings of the Chinese. As a proof of this, it
is right to mention that the same persons again came up a
few days afterwards, and resided with their husbands in one
of the factories, and that <i>that very factory</i> was the first attacked,
and unquestionably the object was to drive out the
foreign ladies, as much as it was to plunder. They escaped,
with the utmost difficulty and danger, by a back way, and
were received into one of the Hong merchants' warehouses
until they could be conveyed down the river. But the mob
destroyed and tore into shreds every article of their wardrobe
which they could find.</p>

<p>In justice to the Chinese, and to the very proper and
cautious measures adopted by Sir Henry Pottinger, this incident
cannot be omitted. But the mob evidently had its
leaders; and many of the people were said to be provided
with little bags of gunpowder, for the purpose of setting fire
to the buildings. There was certainly some preconcerted
scheme or other, although the occurrence of the outbreak on
that <i>particular day</i> was a matter of accident.</p>

<p>Disputes first arose in the early part of the day (7th December)
between a number of Lascars, who were on leave
from Whampoa, and some of the shopkeepers of Canton.
The Lascars are generally allowed to trade a little on their
own private account, and are in the habit of carrying back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
India a great variety of articles, of little cost, purchased in
China. On this occasion, a very large number of them were
allowed to come up to Canton together; hard bargains were
driven, and doubtless there were faults on both sides. High
words soon led to blows and squabbles in some of the back
streets; the disturbance naturally increased by the accession
of recruits to both sides, stones flew and sticks were used, and
at length the Lascars were driven out of the back streets into
one of the unoccupied hongs, called the Creek Hong, which
still remained unrepaired since the general pillage of the Factories
in the previous year.</p>

<p>For some time both parties remained quiet, and probably
those Chinamen who commenced the disturbance had little to
do with what afterwards happened. Towards evening, numbers
of suspicious-looking people began to collect together, in
front of the Factories. Something serious was now anticipated,
and the European residents began to barricade their doors
and windows, and to endeavour to secure their books and
treasure as well as they could. One of the first objects upon
which an attack was made by the mob was the British flag-staff
in the Company's garden, into which they forced their
way. The staff was soon set on fire, (there was no flag,) and
the blaze was followed by a general shout.</p>

<p>The British factory, which was then undergoing repair, was
the next object of violence. The workmen within it defended
it for some time, but the mob at last got in, and were thus
enabled to force their way from the balcony into the adjoining
building, (formerly part of the Company's hong,) in which the
ladies were staying with their friends. Fortunately, however,
they had already been conveyed away to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Elated with success, the mob gradually attacked the other
adjoining factories, particularly that which was formerly occupied
by the Dutch, but which was then rented by an American
firm. Here a stand was made with fire-arms against the invaders
for some time, and two or three of them were shot.
At length, however, they prevailed; and the American gentlemen
had a narrow escape in reaching their boats, but were
only able to save a small quantity of the treasure.</p>

<p>Gradually the crowd increased, as the night set in; parts
of the factories were already on fire, and if the wind had been
high, instead of being nearly calm, it is impossible to say
where the destruction would have stopped, in a city like
Canton.</p>

<p>It will be asked whether no attempt was made by the
Chinese authorities to disperse the mob. For some time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
seem to have been actually themselves <i>afraid</i> of encountering
the mob; and a small party of police-runners and soldiers,
who were sent down in the first instance, were said to have
been driven off. It must not be supposed that all, or even a
quarter part, of the foreign factories were burned down. None
of the rest were injured, except those situated between Hog
Lane and the Creek. Towards morning the mob began to be
satiated with what they had done, and a large body of soldiers
coming down into the square in front of the Factories, headed
by their proper officers, soon managed to enforce quiet. They
retained possession of the square, and pitched their tents, as
if they were to be stationed there for some time.</p>

<p>The alarm created by these violent proceedings among the
foreign community was of course very great indeed. But
whatever the plans of the Chinese may have been, the arrival
of the Proserpine steamer on the following morning at Canton
tended very much to reassure the European community. Sir
Hugh Gough had requested to be conveyed in her to Canton,
merely for the purpose of visiting the town, and it was quite
a matter of fortunate accident that she arrived there just when
she was most wanted. Communications passed between Sir
Hugh Gough and the authorities, who gave every assurance
of their desire to maintain tranquillity. But the difficulty was
as to their <i>power</i> to carry out their own wishes. It was
doubted whether their soldiers could be depended on, and Sir
Hugh Gough, therefore, acceded to the request of the merchants,
to allow the Proserpine to remain off the Factories
until communications could be received from Sir Henry Pottinger.</p>

<p>In every point of view, this was now a very critical moment.
A single false move, or one hasty step, would have led to collision
and difficulty, and might have endangered the existence
of the peace for which we had so long been struggling.
The utmost caution and good judgment were required to allay
the angry feelings on both sides; and it would have ill become
us to have assumed the appearance of almost inviting the
renewal of a collision with a proud susceptible government,
when their high officers declared themselves "both willing and
able to control their own people, and to protect foreigners."</p>

<p>The merchants at Canton addressed Sir Henry Pottinger,
with a view to obtain from him protection for their persons
and property while carrying on their trade at Canton; they
expressed their firm belief that there was a prevailing spirit
of hostility to the English among certain classes in Canton,
by whom the mob were influenced, and that unless <i>armed</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
<i>protection</i> (amounting in reality to armed <i>intervention</i>) were
afforded to them, it would be impossible for them to carry on
their business, except through the means of American agency.
And this kind of assistance was generally deprecated by the
merchants, as tending not only to throw business into the
hands of the Americans for the time, but also to establish it
permanently in their favour, to the detriment of our own mercantile
interests.</p>

<p>The reply of Sir Henry Pottinger to the merchants was a
long and somewhat harshly expressed document. It seemed
to have been written on the spur of the moment, and
amounted, in fact, to a <i>rebuke</i>, addressed to the merchants;
part of which had little reference to the matter in question.
The impression of the Plenipotentiary seems to have been,
that the <i>foreign</i> community were altogether in the wrong; and
his Excellency certainly had in view the extensive, and one
may almost say acknowledged, smuggling, not only of opium,
but of every description of exports and imports which were
liable to duty, in the Canton river.</p>

<p>This was undoubtedly a critical moment of our intercourse
with the Chinese. Sir Henry Pottinger addressed a letter
upon the subject to the Viceroy of Canton, and sent it up by
the Nemesis. It would be difficult to say that this was not
the wisest and most dignified course to pursue. If the Viceroy
should declare either his inability or his unwillingness to protect
the foreign community, then, indeed, would be the proper
time for intervention, in order to secure to them that protection
which they needed.</p>

<p>Captain Hall had previously gone up as a passenger in the
Proserpine, with Captain Hough, to Canton; but the moment
it was ascertained that the Nemesis had passed the Bogue, in
charge of his chief officer, he went down to meet her, and
brought her safely straight up to Canton from Whampoa,
passing through the passage between the stakes below Napier's
fort, and then taking the left-hand passage, by the low alluvial
island. The Proserpine had previously, for the first time,
been carried up the right-hand passage. Both of these lead
up to nearly the same point, opposite the French Folly.</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing of all the foreigners at Canton, the
moment they recognised their old friend the Nemesis approaching.
And who that had once seen her could ever mistake
her appearance, with her two huge eyes upon the bows,
in true Chinese fashion!</p>

<p>On this occasion, the captains of the merchant-vessels at
Whampoa handsomely volunteered to lend their services, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
necessary. There was great uncertainty as to what might
happen, and it was reported that an attempt would be made
upon the steamer at night. It was not forgotten that on
former occasions fire-rafts had been sent down the river to
destroy the shipping, and it was necessary that the Nemesis
and Proserpine should be prepared. The assistance of two
boats only was accepted&mdash;one from the Tuglis, under Captain
Isaacson, and another from the Edinburgh, under Captain
Paterson. Both boats were well armed and manned, and
were of great use in guarding against a surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Medhurst had come up in the Nemesis, as interpreter,
in charge of Sir Henry Pottinger's letter to the Viceroy; and
the question now was, to whom, or through whom, was it to
be delivered? A great number of Chinese soldiers were encamped
on the ground in front of the Factories, for the protection
of the foreigners. They were evidently some of their
best soldiers, for they were well dressed and properly armed.
Each tent was appropriated to about six men; and one of
their large, long shields, placed upright, served as a door to
each; their arms were all in readiness, and sentries were
placed. As for the men themselves, their only occupation
or amusement seemed to be gambling all the day long.</p>

<p>At first the Hong merchants proposed to receive the letter,
but that was, of course, objected to. Then the Kwang-chow-foo,
or Prefect, wished it to be handed over to him on shore,
but that was also refused. It was intimated that it could only
be delivered to him on the quarter-deck of the steamer. At
length a mandarin, who spoke a little English, having formerly
been employed in one of the Hong merchants' establishments,
came alongside, and proposed that Captain Hall
should go into the Prefect's boat, and <i>there</i> deliver the letter,
under the pretence that the Prefect was an <i>old man</i>, and could
not get up the ship's side. All these were little attempts at
evasion, to save his dignity. It was, however, insisted that
the Prefect should come on board the Nemesis, and there
receive the communication, and he might bring as many of the
Hong merchants with him as he pleased.</p>

<p>At length, finding that nothing was to be gained by further
delay, and that the days of paying court to the Prefect were
now long past, he stepped upon the quarter-deck of the
steamer, accompanied by most of the Hong merchants. They
were all conducted into the cabin, and the letter was delivered
in due form, with an intimation that it was to be laid before
the Viceroy without delay, and that a speedy answer was expected.
They then requested that the steamers might be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
lower down, as their presence only tended to keep
alive the excitement. This, however, could not be complied
with. They denied altogether the report that a
large body of troops were advancing towards the city, or
that any violence or insult whatever was intended against the
foreigners. However, it was intimated that the steamers were
perfectly prepared, and that their guns would be kept loaded,
ready to meet any attack that might be made.</p>

<p>The answer of the Viceroy was perfectly satisfactory; and
that it was sincere, the event has since fully proved. He declared
his great anxiety, as well as his perfect <i>ability</i>, to
protect all foreigners; and, at the same time, expressed his
readiness to repay all such losses as had been incurred during
the late riots, after they should have been correctly ascertained,
and transmitted through her Majesty's government.</p>

<p>There have been no grounds whatever for supposing that
there will be any probability of another collision with the
Chinese, to whose moderation and good faith, since the terms
of peace have been settled, too much justice cannot be done.
When we consider the wonderful changes which have been
brought about in so short a period of time, and these, too, in
the face of a nation the most proud, the most prejudiced, and
the vainest in the world, we cannot but look back with wonder
at all that has happened, and stand firm in our belief that
Providence has yet greater things in store for China, mainly
through the instrumentality of England.</p>

<p>A new era is undoubtedly now opened for the Chinese;
new duties and new relations have been imposed upon them;
but let us not forget, in the fulness of victory, and in the pride
of the human heart, that new and highly important duties are
imposed upon us also, not lightly to be thought of, nor inconsiderately
handled. We must take for our motto, forbearance,
good-will, kindliness, honesty, and true Christian feeling.
With these as our panoply, the benefit to be derived by both
nations from the cautious, systematic, and prudent exercise
of the duties imposed upon each other, may become a blessing
to both. Let it also be borne in mind, that qualities the reverse
of these&mdash;overbearing violence, and, above all, undue
love of gain&mdash;may entail, not only misery and the horrors of
anarchy upon a people who proudly boast of their antiquity
and of their vast resources, but may also bring political difficulties,
with loss of dignity and of high principle, upon that
little distant speck upon the earth's surface, yet that giant in
the world's interest&mdash;Great Britain.</p>

<p>At the latter end of December, the whole of the transports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
and ships of war not required for further service in China
sailed from Hong-Kong for their respective destinations; and
peace seemed now to reign throughout the whole of that vast
portion of the East.</p>

<p>Before daylight on the morning of the 23rd of December,
the Nemesis was destined to take her departure from Macao,
and probably to bid adieu to China for ever. It is not too
much to say, that she was regretted by all.</p>

<p>Before three o'clock she was under way; and the discharge
of a few rockets and the report of her guns gave notice of her
departure to the still sleeping inhabitants, who were quite unused
to the disturbance at that early hour in the morning.
It caused some little alarm among the inmates of the houses
on the Praya Grand, fronting the bay. But the Governor,
who resides there, had been previously told, in a good-humoured
way, that he must not be alarmed at a little noise
during the night. When daylight broke, the Nemesis was
out of sight of Macao.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>As the extent of the wear and tear of the vessel, after three
years' service of a trying kind, was not precisely known, it was
not thought prudent to run out into the middle of the China
Sea, during the strength of the monsoon. She therefore
coasted along towards the island of Hainan, in order that she
might be able to take shelter, if a gale came on. It was
perhaps fortunate that she did so. The weather was extremely
pleasant and warm, but looked unsettled. The appearance of
the coast, as we ran along it, at the distance of five or six
miles, was bold and mountainous, but not very fertile, as far
as we could judge at that distance.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, we passed through a large fleet of
fishing-junks, dragging their huge nets before the wind. The
Chinese fishermen did not appear alarmed at the approach of
the steamer, and from one of them we procured an enormous
fish, weighing no less than eighty-eight pounds, and differing
in appearance from any we had hitherto seen. It had a large
flat head, but small mouth, and was of a greenish-yellow
colour. When dressed, it was found eatable, but rather
strong.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>
<p>We soon passed very near the curious conical rock, called
the Mandarin's Peak or Cap, and kept the coast in view until
dark. On the following day, the weather was extremely hazy
and unsettled, and there was a heavy swell setting in from
seaward. We had hoped to have been able to land on Hainan
on Christmas-day, and to have drank the health of absent
friends on terra firma; but the hazy weather detained the
vessel, and she only anchored, as the night set in, in a fine
sandy bay in seven fathoms water; the wind howled over our
heads, and made it the more satisfactory that we had kept near
the land.</p>

<p>As mention has been made of having passed through a
fleet of fishing-junks, it will be proper here to warn all vessels
against being off their guard on such occasions. The fishermen
along the whole coast of this part of China, as far as
Canton, are rogues, pirates, smugglers&mdash;in short, ready to
take advantage of any opportunity, honest or otherwise, of
benefiting themselves. They will, perhaps, appear quite
friendly at first; and if they then find that a vessel is not
prepared to resist, or if they think that they could overpower
her, the chances are that they would not hesitate to make the
attempt, when least expected. Never trust yourself in a
strange place ashore without <i>at least one</i> double-barrelled
pistol in your pocket, and never admit a Chinaman on board,
(if a number of fishing-boats are about,) <i>on this coast</i>, without
being prepared to prevent treachery. This caution is not
unnecessary to ordinary merchant vessels, because it commonly
happens that, although they have arms on board, the
ammunition can seldom be found when it is wanted in a hurry,
and not unfrequently, when the barrels of the muskets are
clean and the bayonets bright, the locks have got no flints. It
is at night that the Chinese would be most likely to make the
attempt, and for this reason the opium clippers are always
well armed and manned. This is found necessary for their
own <i>protection</i>, and not, as many have supposed, to compel
the Chinese to purchase the drug.</p>

<p>The bay in which we anchored was situated a little to the
eastward of Liengsoy, or Tongsoy Bay, as laid down in the
charts. On the following morning, as we proceeded towards
the latter bay, we could clearly distinguish a sunken reef,
running out from the east point of it, to the distance of nearly
a mile. At the extremity of it, numerous fishing-boats were
busily occupied, and with some difficulty a pilot was procured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
from one of them, to take us into Liengsoy Bay. He was
found of little use, as it was easy to make our way in without
him; but he seemed highly pleased when a dollar was given
to him, with a view to encourage others to come to the
assistance of any other vessel that might require a pilot.</p>

<p>Liengsoy is a fine bay, perfectly sheltered during the north-east
monsoon, but a little exposed to the south-west. From
the depth of the bay, and from its being sheltered to the
westward by a long chain of rocky mountains, it is well protected
on that side, while the long reef forms a natural breakwater
upon the east side. It is open only to the southward;
and, from the height to which the sand is blown up upon the
northern beach, it is evident that the wind sets in sometimes
with great violence.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the bay was a narrow opening, not very
easily seen at a distance, which led into a large salt-water
lagoon. We pulled towards it in the steamer's cutter, and
soon discovered a small half-dilapidated stone fort, on the left
hand, near which was a small government station, distinguished
by its flag, but the inmates (although one of them, a fine
stout fellow, was probably a mandarin) were very poor and
humble. They invited us to land, and very civilly gave us
tea, and let us smoke our cigars in their small dwelling, built
of half mud, half mats, but more comfortable within than the
exterior promised. Thence we walked along a fine sandy
beach, bordering the lagoon, until we came to a tolerable
village, situated in the middle of a fine cocoa-tree plantation.
It appeared to be principally inhabited by fishermen&mdash;fine,
stout, well-made people; and the large quantity of sharks'
fins which were fixed upon stakes, and put out to be dried
by the sun, along the edge of the lagoon, sufficiently indicated
the principal occupation of the people. The huts were built
of coral, mud, and bamboo, and were ranged in long lines or
lanes, and the people seemed generally well clothed and
happy. The women were not secluded, but came out to look
at our party, almost as freely as the men. All appeared good-humoured
and well disposed, and offered us plenty of ducks,
fowls, and pigs for sale. It was noticed that, even in this
poor little fishing-village, people were seen reading or writing
in almost every one of the little shops. As we left it again,
the villagers amused themselves by letting off crackers in all
directions&mdash;a Chinaman's delight. Numbers of the people
followed us down to the boat again; and two or three rupees,
distributed among the most deserving, put them all in a good
humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>We could not ascertain whether any river flowed into the
lagoon or not, but no fresh water was seen, although, from the
greater number of trees and the appearance of vegetation at
the upper extremity of it, about a mile and a half distant, we
thought it probable that a small river opened into the lagoon.</p>

<p>Having rejoined the steamer, we stood out of the bay again,
and, having rounded the western extremity, formed by the
range of hills which run quite down to the coast, proceeded
along shore for about a mile, until we entered another fine
bay, remarkable for having three entrances, and called Galong
Bay. The coast is extremely bold and rocky, covered with
low, stunted shrubs, and there is deep water almost close in
shore. Horsburgh's description and directions were found to
be quite correct; except that the village of which he speaks
could not be found anywhere at the present time. The bay is
one of great extent; and the two rocky islands, called the
Brothers, between which are the channels leading into it from
the westward, are bold and striking objects.</p>

<p>As we proceeded further into the bay, the appearance of its
shores improved; the steep, picturesque mountains on all
sides being clothed with wood from their summit, to the water's
edge. The only perfect shelter for ships from the south-west
is under a low island, called Middle Island, inside the Brothers,
where there is a fine, sandy beach, but not very deep water.
Of course there is perfect shelter from the north-east, and you
have always the advantage of three entrances into the bay.</p>

<p>Having steamed quite round the bay, the Nemesis went out
again by the broadest passage, between one of the Brothers
and the main island, and continued to coast along a bold,
rocky shore, until we entered the beautiful bay of Yin-lin-kan.
The entrance to this is not broad, but sufficiently so for ships
to work in, and then it expands into a fine, bold bay, having
plenty of water in all parts. On proceeding to its farthest
extremity, we found the entrance of what Horsburgh calls a
lagoon; at its entrance it has all the appearance of a lagoon,
and it is not until you get up quite to its extremity, (which
you are able to do in boats,) that you find a river of tolerable
size flowing into it.</p>

<p>The great bay or harbour of Yin-lin-kan is by far the best
of all those that were visited on this coast. There is fine
anchorage in smooth water, perfectly protected from all winds;
indeed, the sea outside cannot even be seen when you are fairly
inside the bay. Several large fishing-junks, of the better kind,
were at anchor there; and the shores were bold and picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>Having found our way into what appeared to be the mouth
of the lagoon, it was determined to stand in, if possible, to
explore it further. The entrance was narrow, and the passage
tortuous; but, by observing the character of the shores on
either side, together with the varying shades of colour in the
water, and with two good men in the chains, and one out on
the jib-boom, the channel into it was found without much
difficulty, the water being deeper than was expected. Fishing-stakes
were seen in several places, so that it seemed probable
that a town or village was not far off. The lagoon, or expanded
river, was now found to turn round to the right, or westward,
and several small junks were at anchor near a few huts upon
the shore. The appearance of the country was very peculiar,
looking very like a flooded valley, about half a mile in breadth,
the shores rising up on either side with a rather steep ascent,
but leaving some low ground at the edge of the lagoon.</p>

<p>The steamer continued to push her way on for about one
mile and a half or two miles, through a shallow channel, until
she had passed a double line of long fishing-stakes, one on
either side. The water was now too shallow: to proceed further,
and the tide was falling, so that it was necessary to
retrace our steps into deeper water, where she anchored for the
night.</p>

<p>On the following morning, at daylight, the weather being
very unsettled and hazy, Captain Hall determined to take his
cutter and pinnace, and proceed to the extremity of the lagoon,
nearly a mile distant, in the hope of finding a river, or probably
some town or village, not far off. The crews were well
armed, in case of a surprise; and we also took our double-barrelled
guns, in the hope of getting a shot or two at some
game. As we approached the end of the lagoon, the water
became very shallow, and the passage difficult to find. We saw
what appeared to us to be deer and pheasant, in abundance,
along the edge of the mountains, on either side; but time was
too precious and the water too shallow, (it being quite low
water,) to permit us to land where we most wished.</p>

<p>At length, after carefully searching for a considerable time,
we found a distinct entrance to a river, nearly at the right
hand corner at the end of the lagoon. It was not easy to
make it out at first; as the banks, which were low, were
thickly covered with mangrove shrubs. The country expanded
into a broad, open valley, beyond which well-wooded hills
could be seen on every side. Cocoa-nut trees were growing in
abundance; and here and there we could descry, in the distance,
small, rich, green spots of cultivated ground, which made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
us think that we should find inhabitants not far off. We had
no difficulty in ascending the river, but discovered no habitations
or appearance of cultivation on its banks. The bare
roots of the mangroves on either side, standing out exposed
into the river, served to shew by their marks that the water
sometimes stood much higher than it then was, and that
floods occasionally took place.</p>

<p>At the distance of about two miles from the entrance, we
came to a narrow, wooden-plank bridge, close to which were
two small junks, or decked boats. One of our boats was sent
higher up to explore; but the river was found divided by a
small island, a little above the bridge, and the water was so
shallow that the pinnace could not proceed without difficulty.
Accordingly, having left a part of the men in charge of the
boats at the bridge, and another party, consisting of an officer
and six men, being ordered to follow at an interval of less than
half an hour, Captain Hall and myself, accompanied by four
men, well armed, set out to explore the country. We soon
fell into a well-beaten, sandy cart-track, which surprised us
not a little, as we had hitherto seen nothing of the kind in
China. It has been already noticed that carts were found to
be in use in the island of Formosa; and it was also known
that they were to be met with in the northern parts of China,
in the neighbourhood of Pekin.</p>

<p>After pursuing our way along this sandy track for about a
mile, we entered a fine cocoa-tree wood, with several neat little
cottages built in the midst of it; and presently we heard a
creaking, or rather, squeaking noise, which seemed to be
nearing us. It was soon found to proceed from three bullock-carts,
rudely built of poles, covered round with matting, and
drawn by buffaloes instead of bullocks. They had more the
appearance of large bales of goods than of carts; the wheels
were made of solid wood, and the axletree was fixed in the
wheel, (as at Formosa,) but turned round under the body of
the cart, causing a loud, squeaking noise at each revolution.</p>

<p>Several teams of buffaloes were passed, dragging timber
down to the river-side, which must be found in abundance in
this neighbourhood, and of good quality; an important consideration
for ships driven into the bay of Yin-lin-kan by
stress of weather.</p>

<p>We soon emerged into a fine, level, grassy plain; upon
which, at intervals, clusters of shrubs and young trees were
passed. Small green parroquets seemed to be very numerous.
The soil, however, was poor and sandy; but the mountains
which bounded the plain, or expanded valley, were covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
with wood; while, lower down towards the river, (or what
appeared to us to be its probable course,) grass-lands and
paddy-fields varied the landscape. We were surprised, however,
at seeing so few people; and, compared with China Proper,
the country appeared to us very thinly populated.</p>

<p>The autumnal tints were still fresh upon the foliage, although
it was past Christmas-day; and the variety of the trees, and
the peculiar conical shape of some of the mountains, thickly
covered with wood to their very summits, combined to give
additional interest and novelty to the character of the country.
Perhaps it struck us the more forcibly, from being <i>different</i>
from anything we had recently seen in China Proper. It was
curious to notice the gradations of verdure according to the
height above the valley. At the bottom, everything was brown
and autumnal, at the top, it was all green and youthful, while
between the two were all the intermediate stages. Here again
we thought we could distinguish deer and pheasants in the
woods along the mountain sides.</p>

<p>Gradually the plain became contracted, and we entered a
regular sort of narrow cart-road, overhung with trees, and cut
at least two feet below the surface, as if the better to give
protection from the sun's rays. This soon led us to some
rich paddy-fields, in the neighbourhood of a village, around
which were gardens planted with the sweet potato and other
vegetables, and apparently cultivated with great care. The
village, or rather hamlet, was very inconsiderable; and we
passed on without halting, in the hope of reaching some town
of consequence. The valley continued to get narrower, and
our road was now sheltered with trees.</p>

<p>A walk of about four miles further brought us to another
considerable village, where we halted for an hour, and took
refreshment in a large public tea-shop. The villagers crowded
good-humouredly round us, and betrayed little fear, although
we were all well armed. We only saw two really <i>poor</i> people
amongst them, and they looked as if they were just let out of
prison. As usual, our dress, appearance, arms, and every
little trifle we carried about us, attracted great attention and
curiosity. They had probably never seen Europeans before;
and when we fired off a musket to please them, their astonishment
was indeed great. Their wants were few, and the necessaries
of life appeared easily obtained; there were some decent
shops in the village, and, as usual, plenty of people who could
read and write.</p>

<p>Altogether the whole appearance of the country gave one
the idea of a newly-colonized spot. We saw no goats or cows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
but plenty of capital pigs and poultry. We still thought that
there might be some considerable town not far off; and by
the help of a small vocabulary, written in Chinese, (which of
course they were able to <i>read</i>,) we ascertained that there was
one some miles off, the direction of which was pointed out to
us. After some hesitation, we determined to proceed; and at
length we reached the extremity of the valley, where there was
merely a footpath, running sometimes between low hills, at
other times through a dense scrub, until at length we crossed
the bed of a river, with a fine rocky bottom and a rapid stream.
Here we halted, to refresh ourselves with a cool draught, when
suddenly a whole posse of people descended the hill on the
other side, and began to cross the river; some were carried in
sedan-chairs, (mandarins, probably,) some were led with chains
round their necks, while others had chains round their legs;
there were also several attendants; and one great man rode
on horseback. They had almost reached the middle of the
river before they observed us, and naturally looked somewhat
alarmed at our appearance. We saluted them, and
then passed on.</p>

<p>Our road now lay among hills, and the ground was broken
and tiresome. We ascended one hill, which was paved all the
way with large rough stones, and we concluded we <i>must</i> be
near the town we were in search of; and the novelty of the
adventure stimulated us to go on, although the heat was
great, and we had still the whole distance to travel back again.
We now ascended a steep eminence a little out of the road,
from which we obtained a magnificent view of the country,
with a fine plain just beyond the hills, bounded by the sea in
the distance. We could see no town, but there could be little
doubt that it lay somewhere in the beautiful plain beneath us.</p>

<p>Having regained the principal path, we proceeded some way
further along the side of a wooded mountain, until we reached
an inn by the road side. Here again we got tea, and smoked
our cigars, on perfect good terms with the Chinese, our fellow-travellers.
A consultation was now held. It seemed probable
that the town we were attempting to reach was that of Lychew,
upon the sea-coast, about ten or twelve miles from the capital
of the island. The day was already far advanced, and we had
still about twelve miles to get back again to our boats. Moreover,
we thought it very likely that by returning at once we
should meet the sedan chairs empty, and the horse without
its rider, returning to the town, after having escorted their
prisoners, and thus we should manage to get ourselves <i>carried</i>
back to our boat. We determined, therefore, not to proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
further, although we much longed to descend into the valley
beyond.</p>

<p>It surprised us that, considering we were without doubt the
first Europeans who had been seen in that part of the country,
the people shewed not the slightest rudeness or troublesome
curiosity. They all seemed much more taken up with the
appearance of one of the black Kroomen, who attended us,
than with the Europeans.</p>

<p>After proceeding two or three miles on our way back, we
fortunately met the sedan-chairs and the horse returning. We
soon made them halt, and tried to come to terms for them to
carry us all the way down to our boats. Captain Hall mounted
the horse without any ceremony; but the poor fellows who
had charge of it cried so lustily, and from their manner made
us believe that they would be so terribly punished, that at last
they were allowed to proceed unmolested.</p>

<p>Next came a grand dispute about the sedan-chairs, rickety
old things made of bamboo; but we soon got into them, (there
were only two,) and held out a dollar; but between fear and
disinclination to the job, the men set us down, and left us in
the lurch. However, as we kept possession of the chairs, we
had the best of the bargain, though it was not a very pleasant
prospect for us to sit there until it should please the men to
carry us on. At length, after some deliberation among themselves,
they agreed to carry us for a dollar each, and away we
went, greatly enjoying the fun.</p>

<p>On reaching the village at which we had before halted, they
set us down again in order to rest themselves, and tried every
means to persuade us to alight, and take some tea; but we
were rather too old travellers to be taken in by such tricks,
and continued to keep possession of our chairs. At length,
finding they could not get rid of us, they made up their minds
to carry us on the whole way, and trotted off nimbly enough.
The easy, measured step of the Chinese bearers, who carry the
poles upon their shoulders, one on either side, with a cross
piece joining them together, and resting upon the back of the
neck, is by no means disagreeable; and considering the rudeness
of the construction of the chairs, we were surprised that
the motion was so pleasant.</p>

<p>Presently we fell in with the other party which had been
desired to follow us, and received a very good account of the
civility they had met with from the people. Indeed, they
stated that they had overtaken a respectable-looking Chinaman
on horseback, as they were marching along, who, seeing a
young midshipman of the party, among so many stout men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
very gallantly dismounted, and offered him the use of his
horse; intimating by his manner and gestures that he was too
young to walk so far. This little piece of attention was the
more remarkable as horses are seldom used by the Chinese,
and are usually only found in the hands either of people of
rank or of great wealth. On reaching a road which branched
off to the left, the polite gentleman resumed his horse and
disappeared.</p>

<p>At length we reached the beautiful cocoa-nut wood near the
river, and refreshed ourselves with the milk of the fresh nuts,
under the shade of the trees, which were here growing to a
very great height.</p>

<p>Having regained our boats, we found a number of Chinese
collected round them, but no violence or insult had been
offered; indeed, the peasants had brought down fowls and
ducks for sale.</p>

<p>It was now almost sunset, and the tide was just beginning
to turn, so that we descended the river rapidly, and, as we
emerged from it into the lagoon, it was christened Hall's
River, with our last glass of cherry-brandy, a little of which
we had taken with us for the journey.</p>

<p>As it was still nearly high-water, the appearance of the
lagoon was much more striking than it had been in the morning,
and we could see plenty of game coming out of the woods,
to feed upon the little green patches at the foot of the hills.
But not a single human habitation could be discovered. We
soon reached the steamer again, and instantly getting under
way, proceeded out of the lagoon, or Inner Harbour, as it is
called upon the Admiralty chart.</p>

<p>It should here be remarked, that the entrance to the outer
harbour or <i>basin</i> of Yin-lin-kan, as laid down in the chart,
is much toe broad and the bay too open; at least, such is the
impression from what we remember of the very <i>moderate</i>
breadth of the entrance, and of the appearance of the basin
when inside of it. There was a heavy swell outside, the result
of the strong breezes which had prevailed for several preceding
days.</p>

<p>We now stood across the Gulf of Tonquin, towards the
coast of Cochin-China, which we kept in sight all the way
down. On the 29th we ran into the large and beautiful basin,
called by Horsburgh, Phuyen Harbour, in latitude 18° 23' N.,
with a view to ascertain its character and capabilities, which
could be done with very little detention. The importance of
an accurate knowledge of the best harbours for ships to run
into, in the China Sea, in case of need, cannot be overrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
now that there is every probability of a great increase in the
number of merchant ships passing up and down. The great
Phuyen Basin, which in fact contains <i>three</i> excellent harbours,
is accurately described by Horsburgh. We steamed round it
in all directions, and were struck with its beauty, and the perfect
shelter it affords. The soundings were very regular, from
twelve, to five and a quarter, and four and a half fathoms.
The Buoy Rock, which is the only danger, is distinctly seen
above water, at ebb-tide, looking precisely like what its name
indicates. As we came out again at high-water, it was found
covered. It lies about half way up the first or outer harbour,
at the distance of half to one-third of a mile from the northern
shore.</p>

<p>Just at the entrance to this harbour, near its southern shore,
stands the high, abrupt, rocky island, called Nest Island,
which, although there is deep water close in, on either side,
has a coral reef running out from its western extremity. The
three harbours are, first, Xuandai, on the southern shore,
round Nest Island; next, Vunglam, on the north-western
side, about a mile and a half further up; and lastly, Vungchao,
at the end of the basin.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the beauty and security of the spot,
shut in on all sides, like a large lake, the shores being bold
and mountainous, but not much wooded. Further inland, to
the westward, the country appeared fertile and well cultivated,
but not laid out in terraces along the hill sides, as in most
parts of China-Proper, but divided into small fields with hedgerows
round them, putting one very much in mind of some
parts of England.</p>

<p>We were disappointed in not finding a town of some size
along the shores of the basin; but, as the soil is there generally
poor, while there was evidently a rich valley a little in the rear
to the westward, we concluded that it was probably situated in
that more favoured spot. There were however two hamlets,
one on either side of the extremity of the bay, situated in the
midst of a fine cocoa-nut wood; and in a little bay in the east
corner we found a very extensive burial-ground, with a number
of large tombs, and a small chapel. We could learn nothing
of its history, but concluded that it was the cemetery for
wealthy people belonging to some town not far distant. We
landed, and rambled among the curious tombs, different in
appearance from those either of the Chinese or the Malays.
There were a few fishermen's huts in the neighbourhood, but
the people were poor and ill-clothed, and their features far
from prepossessing. The men were small in stature, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
every respect an inferior-looking people to the inhabitants of
Hainan.</p>

<p>A vast number of large, well-built fishing-boats were
sailing about the great basin, built very sharp at both ends,
and of great length. They carry an enormous sail, very
broad, but not high, cut square, but yet not like a lug-sail. It
was made of a strong kind of grass cloth. As this powerful
sail must of course endanger the safety of their long narrow
boat, they adopt a curious mode of counterbalancing it, so as
to keep the boat upright. A long straight stout spar is run
out to windward from the middle of the vessel, and upon this
three or four men (more or less according to the strength of
the wind) crawl out, and sit upon the extremity, dangling
their legs over the water in a manner not to be envied.
From long habit, they sit there very contentedly, for a length
of time, almost entirely naked, and appear to think that no
other kind of ballast is needed. If the wind were suddenly to
change, they would probably get a ducking, by their own
weight bearing down the boat, with such a lever. But, as the
monsoon blows pretty regularly here, they are not afraid of
sudden changes. If they have occasion to put about, the
men all come in first, and then rig out the spar upon the
opposite side, crawling out upon it again as before.</p>

<p>Two or three better kind of vessels were seen, differently
rigged, something like our lattine-rig, and they looked and
sailed remarkably well. The people did not appear at all
afraid of the steamer, although they looked on in evident
wonder, as she moved so steadily through the harbour.</p>

<p>The same afternoon, we pursued our voyage; and on the
5th of January, the Nemesis steamed into Singapore, decorated
with a number of Chinese flags, and was cheered by several of
the transports as she passed. The next day, nearly all the
rest of the squadron set sail again, leaving the Nemesis to
follow, as soon as her fuel was completed.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 12th, the Nemesis again pursued
her voyage; and on the 14th, at daylight, anchored in the
shallow open bay of Malacca. The view of the town and
coast from the bay is striking; there is a <i>Malay look</i> about it,
and much less of the European character than in Singapore.
There is a rich flat belt of country along the coast, thickly
covered with cocoa-nut trees; while a hill adjoining the town,
upon which there is the ruin of a church, with a flag-staff,
and a saluting battery, forms a marked point in the prospect.</p>

<p>Everything at Malacca distinctly indicates the "tempora
mutantur" of by-gone days; the dull stillness of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the mixture of Dutch countenances, modified by long descent
in a tropical country, the <i>fallen-off</i> look of the public buildings,
point out the little value which is set upon Malacca in
the present day. The kind attentions of the governor, however,
induced us to pay a short visit a few miles into the
interior, where we obtained a splendid view of a fine, rich,
well-wooded, and well-watered country. We were evidently
in the favoured regions of the spice plantations.</p>

<p>We had just arrived in time to disturb a nest of Malay
pirates who had landed the day before, and had robbed one of
the neighbouring villages, killing or wounding several of the
inhabitants. The steamer's boats were immediately sent away
manned and armed, at the governor's request, and accompanied
by a large hired boat, carrying a strong body of police.
A search-warrant had been obtained for the purpose of examining
two or three small junks which had recently come
into the bay, but nothing suspicious was found on board.
The boats then pulled off towards two islands several miles
distant, where it was thought the pirates might lie concealed;
but nothing was discovered. The matter was then left entirely
in the hands of the police, and the steamer's boats returned.</p>

<p>The same evening we again pursued our voyage towards
Penang, or Prince of Wales's Island, the so-called gem of the
eastern seas. Our course was taken as close along shore as
was possible; and instead of passing through the narrow
channels between the sands in the middle of the straits, we
pushed through the Calam Strait, just above the Parcellar
Hill, and found the passage broad and safe, the shores on
both sides being bold and well wooded.</p>

<p>On the 17th, we reached the truly beautiful island of Penang,
a spot which becomes the more striking the oftener it
is seen, and anchored in a small sandy bay close to the fort,
inside the Dido, 20, under the command of the Honourable
Captain Keppel. Enough has already been said of this lovely
spot in the early part of this work. Its clean and regular
town, its excellent roads, beautiful villas, and rich plantations
of spices of all kinds, and of cocoa-nuts, added to the picturesque
beauties of the landscape on every side, cannot be
forgotten by any who have visited them.</p>

<p>The hospitality and good feeling of the inhabitants of
Penang cannot be exceeded. There is a considerable population
of Chinese upon the island, (in addition to Malays,
Indians, and Europeans,) who, besides being excellent mechanics,
enter largely into the cultivation of spice trees, and
often become not only honest and useful tenants, but actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
proprietors of small plantations. It is worth remembering,
that from its geographical position, there is not half an
hour's difference in the rising and setting of the sun at Penang
throughout the whole year.</p>

<p>There is one curiosity in natural history very common on
this island which I had never seen elsewhere&mdash;viz., the
trumpet beetle. Although not large itself it has a long
trumpet-shaped proboscis, or kind of feeler, from which it
emits so loud and long a sound, among the woods by the
mountain's sides, that you can scarcely believe that any insect
could possibly send forth such a tone. It gave one more the
idea of the sound which a bird might utter, such, for instance,
as that of the bell-bird, or the whip-bird, or the laughing
jackass (vernacularly called) met with in New South Wales.</p>

<p>One of the largest trees on record is to be found at Penang.
It is one hundred and thirty feet high to the <i>first branch</i>, and
thirty-six feet round in the largest part.</p>

<p>After a few days' detention at Penang, to complete some
necessary repairs and to take in coal, we bade adieu, with
many regrets, to that lovely island, and coasted along all the
way towards the entrance of the Moulmein river, at the mouth
of which we found the Endymion at anchor, having Sir Hugh
Gough and staff on board. Having delivered the despatches
and letter-bags, we proceeded up the river in charge of a
pilot, for the purpose of getting coal. The river was found
broader and deeper than had been expected, well wooded on
both sides; indeed, a great quantity of valuable timber is
exported from Moulmein, and large ships are built there extremely
well and cheap. The H.C. steamer Tenasserim was
built in this river after the model of The Queen, built in England,
and has answered extremely well.</p>

<p>Two of H.M. brigs were at anchor off the town, besides
two small vessels and gun-boats belonging to the East India
Company. Moulmein was garrisoned by a force of about 4000
men, including one European regiment. It is the frontier
town of Burmah, on its southern side, lying just opposite
Martaban, where it was said the Burmese had collected a
large army just before we made peace with China; probably
with no friendly feeling towards us. The town itself is in its
infancy, but has made great progress within the last few years.
There is a magnificent view of the surrounding country, and
of the river both above and below, and also of the distant town
of Martaban, from the top of a high conical hill, upon which
are several curious temples built after the Burmese fashion.
The town must be considered rather as a large frontier military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
station than as a place of trade, and the soil is generally
poor and sandy.</p>

<p>By the kindness of the Governor, who politely lent us some
of the Commissariat elephants, we were enabled to make an
excursion to see the very remarkable caves, distant about
fifteen miles from the town. We had to ascend the river in
a boat, for some miles, when we landed on the opposite side,
where the elephants were in readiness for us. The sun was
excessively hot, so that umbrellas were necessary. As elephant-riding
was quite new to us, and the animals themselves, moreover,
were only accustomed to carry heavy burdens, it was no
easy matter to mount them at all, even when they had knelt
down. At last, however, we contrived to scramble up by the
tail, making use of it as a rope.</p>

<p>After a ride of seven or eight miles, we came to several
isolated wooded rocks of great height, standing up on the
surface of an extensive plain, unbroken by any other objects.
They were covered more or less with wood, from the base to
the summit, the trees growing to a great height among the
crags, in a manner which made you wonder how the soil in
which they grew could have come there. The caverns were
very large and deep, showing a beautiful stalactitic formation.
The effect was extremely beautiful, when lighted up with blue
lights, putting one very much in mind of the blue grotto on
the island of Capri, in the bay of Naples; indeed, you could
fancy that the sea had only recently retired from these caverns,
so fresh was the appearance of their walls. In the cooler part
of the evening, we returned to our boats, and soon reached
Moulmein again.</p>

<p>On the following day, having completed the necessary quantity
of coal, we descended the river, and steered our course
direct for Calcutta, which we reached on the 6th of February.
We passed a great many of our old friends, the transports,
waiting for tugs to tow them up, and arrived off Fort William,
just at the most fashionable hour for the promenade along
the river side. The steamer was decorated with numerous
Chinese flags, and several officers had come up from on board
the transports, who were anxiously looking out for their
friends upon the banks. Having passed quite up above the
fort, among all the shipping, we returned down towards the
principal landing-place, attracting the attention and curiosity
of thousands, who were collected to look at the Nemesis, of
which they had heard so much. A salute was fired, which
was returned by the fort; and there at length quietly lay the
Nemesis, resting from all her toils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Calcutta, the City of Palaces, and of the kindness and
hospitality of its inhabitants, little need be said. Great honours
were done to those who had fought for their country, in China
and Affghanistan; and balls, dinners, illuminations, and fêtes
of all kinds, were the order of the day.</p>

<p>The last service performed by the Nemesis, under her old
commander, was to convey Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh
Gough and his staff up the river to Barrackpore, to review the
garrison stationed there; including the remnant of the Bengal
Volunteers recently returned. It was an excursion of duty,
but in reality not less one of pleasure.</p>

<p>We may now bid adieu to the Nemesis. Sufficient evidence
has been given of the vast utility of iron steamers of <i>moderate</i>
size, in service upon an enemy's coast. The danger which
some have apprehended from the rusting of the rivets by which
the iron plates are fastened together, or from their <i>starting</i>,
through the concussions to which the vessel may be liable,
was proved to be almost totally unfounded. The corrosion
of her bottom can be prevented to a great extent, by constantly
painting it with red lead&mdash;an operation which is much facilitated
by the ease and safety with which a flat-bottomed iron
vessel can be laid ashore. It must not be forgotten, however,
that barnacles adhere more readily and firmly to an iron
vessel, than they do to one coppered over.</p>

<p>At Calcutta, the Nemesis was docked and examined, before
being sent round to Bombay for a thorough repair. She was
pronounced to be in a perfectly fit state to perform the
voyage, without risk; and she ultimately arrived safely at
Bombay, under the command of Lieutenant Fell, I.N., who
carried her successfully through the intricate passage between
Ceylon and the mainland. At Bombay, the Nemesis was
docked; and the following extract of a letter, dated Bombay,
June 19, 1843, will surprise those who are unacquainted with
the durability of iron steamers:&mdash;"The Nemesis has been for
some time past in our docks, and I have carefully examined her.
She displays, in no small degree, the advantages of iron. Her
bottom bears the marks of having been repeatedly ashore; the
plates are deeply indented in many places, in one or two to
the extent of several inches. She has evidently been in contact
with sharp rocks, and one part of her keel-plate is bent
sharp up, in such a way as I could not believe that <i>cold</i> iron
could bear; indeed, unless the iron had been extremely good,
I am sure it would not have stood it without injury. Her
bottom is not nearly as much corroded as I expected to have
found it, and she is as tight as a bottle."</p>

<h2><a name="B" id="B">B.</a></h2>

<div class="center"><big>GENERAL REGULATIONS</big></div>

<div class="center">UNDER WHICH THE BRITISH TRADE IS TO BE CONDUCTED AT THE<br />
FIVE PORTS OF CANTON, AMOY, FOO-CHOW-FOO, NINGPO, AND SHANGHAI.<br /><br />
</div>


<div class="center"><i>I. Pilots.</i></div>

<p>Whenever a British merchantman shall arrive off any of the
five ports opened to trade&mdash;viz., Canton, Foochowfow, Amoy,
Ningpo, or Shanghai, pilots shall be allowed to take her immediately
into port; and, in like manner, when such British ship shall
have settled all legal duties and charges, and is about to return
home, pilots shall be immediately granted to take her out to sea,
without any stoppage or delay.</p>

<p>Regarding the remuneration to be given these pilots, that will be
equitably settled by the British Consul appointed to each particular
port, who will determine it with due reference to the distance gone
over, the risk run, &amp;c.</p>


<div class="center"><i>II. Custom-house Guards.</i></div>

<p>The Chinese Superintendent of Customs at each port will adopt
the means that he may judge most proper to prevent the revenue
suffering by fraud or smuggling. Whenever the pilot shall have
brought any British merchantman into port, the Superintendent of
Customs will depute one or two trusty custom-house officers, whose
duty it will be to watch against fraud on the revenue. These will
either live in a boat of their own, or stay on board the English ship,
as may best suit their convenience. Their food and expenses will
be supplied them from day to day from the custom-house, and they
may not exact any fees whatever from either the commander or
consignee. Should they violate this regulation, they shall be
punished proportionately to the amount so exacted.</p>


<div class="center"><i>III. Masters of Ships reporting themselves on Arrival.</i></div>

<p>Whenever a British vessel shall have cast anchor at any one of
the above-mentioned ports, the captain will, within four and twenty
hours after arrival, proceed to the British Consulate, and deposit
his ship's papers, bills of lading, manifest, &amp;c., in the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
Consul; failing to do which, he will subject himself to a penalty of
two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>For presenting a false manifest, the penalty will be five hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>For breaking bulk and commencing to discharge, before due permission
shall be obtained, the penalty will be five hundred dollars,
and confiscation of the goods so discharged.</p>

<p>The Consul, having taken possession of the ship's papers, will
immediately send a written communication to the Superintendent of
Customs, specifying the register tonnage of the ship, and the particulars
of the cargo she has on board; all of which being done in
due form, permission will then be given to discharge, and the duties
levied as provided for in the tariff.</p>


<div class="center"><i>IV. Commercial Dealings between English and Chinese Merchants.</i></div>

<p>It having been stipulated that English merchants may trade with
whatever native merchants they please, should any Chinese merchant
fraudulently abscond or incur debts which he is unable to discharge,
the Chinese authorities, upon complaint being made thereof,
will of course do their utmost to bring the offender to justice: it
must, however, be distinctly understood, that if the defaulter really
cannot be found, or be dead, or bankrupt, and there be not wherewithal
to pay, the English merchants may not appeal to the former
custom of the Hong merchants paying for one another, and can no
longer expect to have their losses made good to them.</p>


<div class="center"><i>V. Tonnage Dues.</i></div>

<p>Every English merchantman, on entering any one of the above-mentioned
five ports, shall pay tonnage-dues at the rate of five mace
per register ton, in full of all charges. The fees formerly levied on
entry and departure, of every description, are henceforth abolished.</p>


<div class="center"><i>VI. Import and Export Duties.</i></div>

<p>Goods, whether imported into, or exported from, any one of the
above-mentioned five ports, are henceforward to be taxed according
to the tariff as now fixed and agreed upon, and no further sums are
to be levied beyond those which are specified in the tariff; all duties
incurred by an English merchant vessel, whether on goods imported
or exported, or in the shape of tonnage-dues, must first be paid up
in full; which done, the Superintendent of Customs will grant a
port clearance, and this being shewn to the British Consul, he will
thereupon return the ship's papers and permit the vessel to depart.</p>


<div class="center"><i>VII. Examination of Goods at the Custom-house.</i></div>

<p>Every English merchant, having cargo to load or discharge, must
give due intimation thereof, and hand particulars of the same to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Consul, who will immediately despatch a recognised linguist of his
own establishment to communicate the particulars to the Superintendent
of Customs, that the goods may be duly examined, and
neither party subjected to loss. The English merchant must also
have a properly-qualified person on the spot, to attend to his interests
when his goods are being examined for duty, otherwise, should there
be complaints, these cannot be attended to.</p>

<p>Regarding such goods as are subject by the tariff to an <i>ad valorem</i>
duty, if the English merchant cannot agree with the Chinese officer
in fixing a value, then each party shall call two or three merchants
to look at the goods, and the highest price at which any of these
merchants would be willing to purchase shall be assumed as the value of
the goods.</p>

<p>To fix the tare on any article, such as tea, if the English merchant
cannot agree with the custom-house officer, then each party shall
choose so many chests out of every hundred, which, being first
weighed in gross, shall afterwards be tared, and the average tare
upon these chests shall be assumed as the tare upon the whole; and
upon this principle shall the tare be fixed upon all other goods in
packages.</p>

<p>If there should still be any disputed points which cannot be
settled, the English merchant may appeal to the Consul, who will
communicate the particulars of the case to the Superintendent of
Customs, that it may be equitably arranged. But the appeal must
be made on the same day, or it will not be regarded. While such
points are still open, the Superintendent of Customs will delay to
insert the same in his books, thus affording an opportunity that the
merits of the case may be duly tried and sifted.</p>


<div class="center"><i>VIII. Manner of Paying the Duties.</i></div>

<p>It is hereinbefore provided, that every English vessel that enters
any one of the five ports shall pay all duties and tonnage-dues before
she be permitted to depart. The Superintendent of Customs
will select certain shroffs, or banking establishments of known
stability, to whom he will give licences, authorizing them to receive
duties from the English merchants on behalf of Government, and
the receipt of these shroffs for any moneys paid them shall be
considered as a government voucher. In the paying of these duties,
different kinds of foreign money may be made use of; but as foreign
money is not of equal purity with sycee silver, the English Consuls
appointed to the different ports will, according to time, place, and
circumstances, arrange with the Superintendents of Customs at each
what coins may be taken in payment, and what per centage may be
necessary to make them equal to standard or pure silver.</p>


<div class="center"><i>IX. Weights and Measures.</i></div>

<p>Sets of balance-yards for the weighing of goods, of money weights,
and of measures, prepared in exact conformity to those hitherto in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
use at the Custom-house of Canton, and duly stamped and sealed in
proof thereof, will be kept in possession of the Superintendent of
Customs, and also at the British Consulate at each of the five ports,
and these shall be the standards by which all duties shall be charged,
and all sums paid to government. In case of any dispute arising
between British merchants and Chinese officers of Customs, regarding
the weights or measures of goods, reference shall be made to these
standards, and disputes decided accordingly.</p>


<div class="center"><i>X. Lighters, or Cargo Boats.</i></div>

<p>Whenever any English merchants shall have to load or discharge
cargo, he may hire whatever kind of lighter or cargo-boat he pleases,
and the sum to be paid for such boat can be settled between the
parties themselves without the interference of government. The
number of these boats shall not be limited, nor shall a monopoly of
them be granted to any parties. If any smuggling take place in
them, the offenders will of course be punished according to law.
Should any of these boat-people, while engaged in conveying goods
for English merchants, fraudulently abscond with the property, the
Chinese authorities will do their best to apprehend them; but, at the
same time, the English merchants must take every due precaution
for the safety of their goods.</p>


<div class="center"><i>XI. Transshipment of Goods.</i></div>

<p>No English merchant ships may transship goods without special
permission: should an urgent case happen where transshipment is
necessary, the circumstances must first be transmitted to the Consul,
who will give a certificate to that effect, and the Superintendent
of Customs will then send a special officer to be present at the
transshipment. If any one presumes to transship without such permission
being asked for and obtained, the whole of the goods so illicitly
transshipped will be confiscated.</p>


<div class="center"><i>XII. Subordinate Consular Officers.</i></div>

<p>At any place selected for the anchorage of the English merchant
ships, there may be appointed a subordinate consular officer, of approved
good conduct, to exercise due control over the seamen and
others. He must exert himself to prevent quarrels between the
English seamen and natives, this being of the utmost importance.
Should anything of the kind unfortunately take place, he will in like
manner do his best to arrange it amicably. When sailors go on
shore to walk, officers shall be required to accompany them, and,
should disturbances take place, such officers will be held responsible.
The Chinese officers may not impede natives from coming alongside
the ships, to sell clothes or other necessaries to the sailors living
on board.</p>

<div class="center"><i>XIII. Disputes between British Subjects and Chinese.</i></div>

<p>Whenever a British subject has reason to complain of a Chinese,
he must first proceed to the Consulate and state his grievance; the
Consul will thereupon inquire into the merits of the case, and do his
utmost to arrange it amicably. In like manner, if a Chinese have
reason to complain of a British subject, he shall no less listen to his
complaint, and endeavour to settle it in a friendly manner. If an
English merchant have occasion to address the Chinese authorities,
he shall send such address through the Consul, who will see that the
language is becoming; and if otherwise, will direct it to be changed,
or will refuse to convey the address. If, unfortunately, any disputes
take place of such a nature that the Consul cannot arrange them
amicably, then he shall request the assistance of a Chinese officer,
that they may together examine into the merits of the case, and decide
it equitably. Regarding the punishment of English criminals,
the English government will enact the laws necessary to attain that
end, and the Consul will be empowered to put them in force: and,
regarding the punishment of Chinese criminals, these will be tried
and punished by their own laws, in the way provided for by the
correspondence which took place at Nankin after the concluding of
the peace.</p>


<div class="center"><i>XIV. British Government Cruisers anchoring within the Ports.</i></div>

<p>An English government cruiser will anchor within each of the five
ports, that the Consul may have the means of better restraining
sailors and others, and preventing disturbances. But these government
cruisers are not to be put on the same footing as merchant
vessels, for as they bring no merchandise and do not come to trade,
they will of course pay neither dues nor charges. The resident
Consul will keep the Superintendent of Customs duly informed of
the arrival and departure of such government cruisers, that he may
take his measures accordingly.</p>


<div class="center"><i>XV. On the Security to be given for British Merchant Vessels.</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>It has hitherto been the custom, when an English vessel entered the
port of Canton, that a Chinese Hong merchant stood security for her,
and all duties and charges were paid through such security-merchant.
But these security-merchants being now done away with, it is understood
that the British Consul will henceforth be security for all British
merchant ships entering any of the aforesaid five ports.</p>

<div class="center"><big>SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY.</big></div>


<p>The following is an abstract of the Supplementary Treaty between
the Queen of Great Britain and the Emperor of China:&mdash;</p>

<p>Art. I. provides for the new tariff being in force at the five
ports of Canton, Foo-chow-foo, Amoy, Ningpo, and Shanghai.</p>

<p>Art. II. provides for the general regulations of trade being in
force at the aforesaid five ports.</p>

<p>Art. III. provides that all penalties or confiscations made under
the 3rd clause of the general regulations of trade shall belong to
the government of China.</p>

<p>Art. IV. provides that British merchants shall be allowed only
to trade at the five ports mentioned in Art. I.; that the British
merchants' ships shall not repair to any other ports or places in
China; that if they do so, in contravention of this article, the
Chinese authorities shall be at liberty to seize and confiscate both
vessel and cargo, and that all Chinese subjects discovered clandestinely
trading with British merchants at any other ports or places
in China shall be punished as the law in China may direct.</p>

<p>Art. V. provides for the 4th clause of the general regulations of
trade being applicable to both parties.</p>

<p>Art. VI. provides that English merchants and others residing at,
or resorting to, the five ports, shall not go into the surrounding
country beyond certain distances, (to be fixed by the local authorities
and consuls,) and "on no pretence for purposes of traffic;"
and that if any person, whatever his rank, station, or calling, disobey
this article and "wander away into the country, he shall be
seized and handed over to the British consul for suitable punishment."</p>

<p>Art. VII. provides for British subjects and their families residing
agreeably to the treaty of perpetual peace and friendship, at the
different ports named in Article I., and for their being allowed to
buy or rent ground or houses at fair and equitable rates, such as
prevail "amongst the people, without exaction on either side. The
ground and houses, so to be sold or rented, to be set apart by the
local authorities in communication with the consuls."</p>

<p>Art. VIII. provides for all foreign countries whose subjects or
citizens have hitherto traded at Canton, being admitted to the five
ports named in Article I., on the same terms as England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>
<p>Art. IX. provides for all Chinese criminals and offenders against
the law, who may flee to Hong-Kong, or to British ships of war, or
to British merchantmen, for refuge, being "delivered, upon proof
or admission of their guilt;" and for any sailor, soldier, or other
person, whatever his caste or country, who is a subject of the
crown of England, and who may, from any cause, or on any pretence,
desert, fly, or escape into the Chinese territory, being seized
and confined by Chinese authorities, and forthwith sent to the
nearest consular, or other British government officer.</p>

<p>Art. X. provides for a British ship of war being stationed at
each of the five ports, "to ensure good order and discipline amongst
the crews of the merchant shipping, and to support the necessary
authority of the consul over British subjects." The crews of such
ship of war to be "carefully restrained by the officer commanding,"
and the rules regarding not straying into the country to be applicable
to them, in the same manner as the crews of merchant ships.
The ships of war to be in no degree liable to port-charges or any
of the general regulations laid down for trade.</p>

<p>Art. XI. provides for the British forces being withdrawn from
Chusan, (Tinghai,) and Coolung-soo being restored to the Chinese
government, agreeably to the treaty of perpetual peace and friendship,
the moment all the moneys stipulated for in that treaty shall
be paid; and "the British plenipotentiary distinctly and voluntarily
agrees that all dwelling-houses, storehouses, barracks, and other
buildings, that the British troops or people may have occupied or
intermediately built or repaired, shall be handed over, on the
evacuation of the ports, exactly as they stand."</p>

<p>Art. XII. provides for the British plenipotentiary instructing the
different consuls (in addition to the proclamation the plenipotentiary
has already issued) "to strictly watch over and carefully scrutinize
the conduct of all persons, being British subjects, trading under
their superintendence," and, in the event of any smuggling transactions
coming to their knowledge, they are to apprise the Chinese
authorities, "who will proceed to seize and confiscate all goods,
whatever their value or nature, that may have bean so smuggled;"
and will likewise "be at liberty to prohibit the vessel from which
the smuggled goods were landed from trading further, and to send
her away as soon as her accounts are adjusted and paid." All
Chinese subjects, whether custom-house officers or others, who
may be discovered to be concerned in smuggling, are, by this
article, to be punished as the Chinese authorities shall think fit.</p>

<p>Art. XIII. provides for all persons, whether native of China or
otherwise, conveying goods to Hong-Kong for sale, on obtaining a
pass or port-clearance from one of the five ports named in Art. I.,
and paying the duties agreeably to the tariff on such goods. It also
provides for natives of China repairing to Hong-Kong to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
goods, and for their obtaining a pass from the custom-house of one
of the five ports, should they require a Chinese vessel to carry away
their purchases. These passes to be restored at the expiration of
each trip.</p>

<p>Art. XIV. provides for an officer of the British Government
examining the registers and passes of all Chinese vessels visiting
Hong-Kong to buy or sell goods; and for any vessel which may
not have a register or pass being "considered an unauthorized
or smuggling vessel," and not being allowed to trade. "By this
arrangement, it is to be hoped that piracy and illegal traffic will be
effectually prevented."</p>

<p>Art. XV. provides for debts, incurred by Chinese dealers or
merchants at Hong-Kong, being recovered through the English
courts of justice. Should the debtor fly from Hong-Kong to the
Chinese territory, and be known or found to have property, real
or personal, the fourth clause of the general regulations will be
applicable to the case, on application being made by the consul.
In like manner, should a British merchant incur debts at any of
the five ports, and fly to Hong-Kong, the British authorities will,
on receiving an application from the Chinese officers, institute an
investigation into the claims, and, when established, oblige the
defaulter or debtor to settle them, to the utmost of his means.</p>

<p>Art. XVI. provides for a monthly return of passes granted to
Chinese vessels to visit Hong-Kong, being furnished to the British
officer referred to in Article XIV., by the hoppo of Canton, and
for a similar return being made by the said officer.</p>

<p>Art. XVII., also termed "Additional Article," provides for all
cutters, schooners, lorchas, and such small vessels that ply between
Canton and Hong-Kong, or between Canton and Macao, passing, as
they have hitherto done, free of all port charges, if they only carry
passengers, letters, or baggage; but if they carry any dutyable
articles, however small the quantity, they are to pay tonnage dues
at the rate of one mace per ton register. This article further
provides for the smallest of such vessels being considered to be
seventy-five tons burden, and the largest one hundred and fifty
tons burden, beyond which last size they are to be classed as foreign
ships, and to be charged tonnage dues according to Article V. of
the general regulations.</p>

<p>The following three rules were further laid down in this article,
which is only applicable to the port of Canton, for the guidance of
these small vessels.</p>

<p>1st. "Every British schooner, cutter, lorcha, &amp;c., shall have a
sailing-letter or register, in Chinese and English, under the seal
and signature of the chief superintendent of trade, describing her
appearance, burden," &amp;c.</p>

<p>2nd. "Every schooner, cutter, lorcha, and such vessels, shall
report herself as large vessels are required to do at the Bocca
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>Tigris; and when she carries cargo she shall also report herself at
Whampoa, and, on reaching Canton, deliver up her sailing-letter
or register to the British Consul, who will obtain permission from
the hoppo for her to discharge her cargo, which she is not to do
without such permission, under the forfeiture of the penalties laid
down in the third clause of the general regulations."</p>

<p>3rd. "When the inward cargo is discharged, and an outward
one (if intended) taken on board, and the duties on both arranged
and paid, the consul will restore the register or sailing-letter, and
allow the vessel to depart."</p>
